Your BBS Will Never Miss an Important Call Again     
==== === ==== ===== ==== == ========= ==== =====
     
     Are you worried that your modems aren't always going to work
properly?  Have you ever had a modem "Flake Out" or had a user report 
that they called your system, but got no answer?
     
     If you run a serious system, modem problems are not acceptable.

     You need Modem Technician, a new program from Computerized
Horizons, the company that brought you "Console Master" and "Hacker
Alarm."
     
     Modem Technician ensures that you don't have any modem-related
problems.  It performs two main tasks:  First, it constantly monitors 
all your modems.  It will alert you audibly whenever it detects any 
of 10 different problems.  Second, it has a suite of thorough 
diagnostic tools that will let you see exactly what your modems are 
doing.

     No matter what brand of modems you use, or their quality, Modem
Technician will make sure that you find out about any problems before
your users do.

     Unlike hardware solutions that cost thousands of dollars, Modem 
Technician was designed for use specifically with Major BBS and 
Worldgroup, and can detect virtually all serious problems that may 
occur.    



CONSTANT MONITORING
===================

     Modem Technician will constantly monitor all of your modems and
their UARTs.  It will detect the following problems on your 
Worldgroup or Major BBS system, and alert you audibly and/or record
the problem to the audit trail


[1] Hardware Ring-no-answer:  Many SysOps have experienced the 
    dreaded "Ring-No-Answer" problem.  Modem Technician detects this
    on both the hardware and software levels.  The hardware level is 
    when the phone is ringing, but the modem does not report the ring 
    to Worldgroup.  This usually is caused by a modem has "flaked 
    out," but can also be caused by a bad init string, or modem 
    format problems.

[2] Software Ring-No-Answer:  Modem Technician also detects this on 
    the software level.  The software level is when the modem 
    properly reports that the phone is ringing, but Major BBS or
    Worldgroup does not properly respond to it.

[3] Phantom User (Software):  A "phantom user" is a user that appears 
    to be online, but is not.  For some reason, Worldgroup does not 
    know that they have hung up.  The software level checks to see if
    the modem microprocessor is reporting that the phone line is 
    ringing, while Worldgroup thinks that a user is online.

[4] Phantom User (Hardware):  This also involves checking for a  
    "Phantom User", but at the hardware level.  This will be 
    triggered when Worldgroup things that a user is online, but the
    modem hardware either detects a ringing signal (even if it is not
    reported to Worldgroup), or that there is no carrier present.

[5] ERROR:  This test will make sure that your modems are not sending 
    an "ERROR" message.  A modem that reports an ERROR has received a
    command that it does not recognize.  The most common cause of
    this is a bad init string.

[6] No Response:  Modem Technician will detect when any of your 
    modems are not responding to commands that are sent to them.  
    This usually means that a modem has "Flaked Out".  A modem in  
    this state is totally unreliable.

[7] Failure to Initialize:  Sometimes modems will get stuck in the 
    "initializing..." state.  Modem Technician will detect this 
    condition, which may occur when an external modem is 
    disconnected, or when Worldgroup tries to communicate to the 
    modem at a speed faster than what the modem can accept.

[8] DSR/CTS Low:  Modem Technician will detect whenever the modems' 
    DSR/CTS lines stay low.  They can naturally go low during the 
    course of an online session, but if they stay low there may be a 
    problem.  This can occur, for example, when an external modem 
    loses its power.

[9] Bad UART Bits:  Certain UART bits are not used, and must be low 
    at all times for proper operation.  You will be alerted if these
    bits are ever high, which usually indicates a faulty UART.  
    
[10] Carrier on Vacant Modem:  Your modems must report the true 
     status of the carrier.  Otherwise, problems will arise.  Modem 
     Technician will alert you if any of your modems are not 
     correctly reporting the carrier status.




MODEM/UART DIAGNOSTICS
======================

     There are four full screens that can be accessed from the local
console that allow you to monitor your modems and UARTs.  This can be
quite useful for determining exactly what the problems are with your 
modems.  The Online Help Screens and the Printed Manual will help you  
make the most of these screens.

     The screens allow you to view all the UART bits for all your 
modems (you can see the UART info for up to 16 modems at a time).
You can also see the UART, Worldgroup, and Max baud rates; as well as
port addresses and init strings.

     Another screen shows you simulated external modem LEDs.  This 
screen will, at a quick glace, let you see the most relevant
information about each modem.

     The final screen is the most important.  It gives you streaming
information on 11 different phases that occur from the time the phone 
rings until a user logs on, and then hangs up again.  The data can be 
shown for 4 different time periods (1/16th second samples, 1/3rd 
second samples, 1-second samples, or 6-second samples).  This lets 
you see from 4 seconds to 6 minutes' worth of data on the screen at 
once.  

     You don't have to use these four screens, since Modem Technician 
will automatically find problems that occur.  However, if you want to 
know exactly what your modems are doing, or if you need to prove to
someone that everything is working properly, this is the only way to 
do it.
