   Our software is released as "ShareWare" which means you have the chance
   to try it before you buy it. Although each product has certain
   limitations, the shareware versions NEVER expire!

   If you wish to upgrade your version of any of our products, simply
   download and install the latest version! Your ShareWare version will
   continue, with no need to reset the player/user files at all.
   
   When you register, your purchase remains good through any upgrades.
   Simply download and install the latest version, and viola! You'll be
   running the latest version, still registered, with no need to reset
   the player/user files.

   When upgrading, there is no difference between the Registered program
   and the ShareWare version of the program. If you were running the demo
   version when you upgrade, you'll continue to run the demo version.
   If you were running the Registered version, you'll continue running the
   registered version. So, upgrading is EASY! Stay current with the
   latest releases for no extra charge!!!

   An "upgrade" is defined as a product version beginning with the same
   number. For example, Lunatix 5.3E is considered an upgrade to Lunatix
   5.0A. Lunatix 6.0A, however, would be a brand new game.

-=-=- LUNATIX -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Version 5.xx

      Lunatix, for use with Worldgroup & MBBS. Now is the time to express
  your insanity, play pranks on other patients, attack each other, flirt
  with the nurse or other patients, and discover tons of other things to
  do in this RPG/Adventure game as you attempt to escape! Lunatix has
  been a hit with Sysops & Players since its original release & it's
  still going strong!

  Features include: ONLINE CNF config (no need to take the BBS offline)
                    A Loan Shark (Genghis Khan)
                    NEW transfer crazy bucks option
                    Useful ITEMS such as a rope, antimatter, Crazy
                       Statue, Killer Sphere, CodeBreaker, Valentine...
                    A "chat wall" in the cafeteria
                    A lab for mixing potions
                    TELECONFERENCING! (Whispers, direct messages, global
                       in-game gossip, and lots of "action" words!)
                    Native IGM support! Lunatix is truly MODULAR!!
                    Player-to-Player flirting (or flirt with a nurse)
                    Player-to-Player in-game mail!
                    Color Codes (player names can even be in color)
                    Lots more! Install it and find out for yourself!!

      We constantly get great feedback from Sysops and players. Lunatix is
  an instant hit. Players love the competition it provides. The IGM add-ons
  are very popular as well. Lunatix is easy to play at the surface, but
  contains many things a player can discover, with lots of techniques and
  tricks to make game play even more fun!

  The latest version for WG1/2/MBBS is LUNAT*.ZIP ("*" is the version).
  The latest version for WG3/NT/WIN95 is LUNWG*.ZIP ("*" is the version).
  The latest version for WG3/DOS is LUNWD*.ZIP ("*" is the version).

-=-=- DISTANT PLACES -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Version 1.xx

      Distant Places is an add-on for Robinson Technologies' popular
  Tournament Legend of the Red Dragon add-on (T-LORD) for WG1/2, MBBS6.25,
  and WG3 (Win95/NT only). Because T-LORD was originally going to be
  released with a scripting language somewhat like you see in Lunatix,
  we were disappointed when Seth chose to release T-LORD with IGM support
  requiring "true" WG/MBBS IGM modules instead.

      This presented a number of disadvantages. Only those people who
  own a Worldgroup Developer's Kit (all the tools you need are VERY
  expensive) could develop IGM's. You would have to be a C++ programmer,
  with a fair amount of skill, to write a T-LORD IGM. For a sysop,
  modules use memory to load, so a game with 20 T-LORD IGM's would be
  using a sizable chunk of RAM! Also, with no constraints, "true" IGM
  modules would have the ability to do anything they darn well
  please -- award billions of gold... make the player a level 12 even if
  they were level 1, and so on. This would be a nightmare for players
  who wanted a fair game. Also, T-LORD IGM's might cost $25 to $50 or
  potentially even more! 20 of them would be a nice amount of money!

      Distant Places was created to fill a vast void (the lack of T-LORD
  IGM's) and help eliminate these problems. DP is an IGM for T-LORD,
  conforming to the guidelines of a WG/MBBS IGM module. However, its
  sole purpose is to give T-LORD the much-needed ability to run "script"
  IGM's -- just like in Lunatix but customized for T-LORD. Anybody can
  create a script IGM, and the kit to write them is free! DP provides
  built-in constraints so prevent IGM's from being written that award
  billions of gold or increase the player's level. Scripts don't require
  extra RAM to run. After DP is loaded, you could have 1 script or 100
  scripts -- you wouldn't notice a single byte more of RAM being used!
  Many DP IGM's are free. Even the ones that aren't range from $5 to
  $10, which is definitely more affordable.

  Look for the latest version as: CWDLI*.ZIP where "*" is the version.
  The latest version for WG3/NT/WIN95 is CWDLG*.ZIP ("*" is the version).

-=-=- MYSTIC MESSAGES -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Version 2.xx

      Mystic Messages, for use with WG1/2 and MBBS6.25, was the first
  module ever to be released by Prowler Productions. At a glance, it's
  a graffiti wall. The most common response is "So? I already have one!"

      MM is more than just an ordinary "add an anonymous line" wall. In
  fact, it's MUCH more, but it's no more difficult to use than those
  walls that do much less!

     >> Users can post ANSI's to the wall! Select from a set of built-in
        pictures including a heart, flowers, a cigarette, "wanna play
        house?" "I love you" "You loooooser" and many many more! The
        ANSI's are small and fit right onto the wall! REAL Graffiti! If
        needed, you can even disable this feature.
     >> Define up to 4 price levels for posting these ANSI's. Simple
        ANSI's for 200 credits, up to the best ANSI's for 2000 credits.
        Set this yourself to more or less (or free) and even give
        a "no charge" key to users you don't wish to charge at all.
     >> Sysops can set a KEY required to read the "real" names of the
        message posters, otherwise message appear anonymous. The default
        key is SYSOP.
     >> Users can write messages in Lunatx-style color! It's easy!
        `9J`3oe `9B`3ob `$`4``WAS `%HERE!!!`h`7 :)
     >> Users who don't know how to use colors codes can easily write
        messages without color:
        Joe Bob WAS HERE!!! :)
     >> Built-in "help" provides a quick way to learn how to use colors.
     >> Colors can be used GLOBALLY on the bbs -- in /P pages, inside
        teleconference, in E-Mail (if using the line-edit mode), in the
        user registries, and more! If this isn't desirable, Sysops can
        disable MM global colors (but most BBS's LOVE the global colors).
     >> The color key can be changed by the sysop. does the ` key pose
        a conflict with another module? No problem. Change it to + or
        \ or one of several others.
     >> Are some users abusing the wall, or using it in violation of
        the BBS rules? Not a problem -- simply give them the "No Wall"
        key (defaults to NOMMWALL) to keep them out! This could even be
        used for the opposite reason -- so that only paying users can
        get in!
     >> Sysops (or an MM-wall-OP, if given the key) can erase individual
        lines (messages) from the wall, or blank out the whole thing!
     >> Messages expire after 3 days to keep it "current." However, set
        it up to expire every day... every week... every month... or
        never at all!
     >> Using Worldgroup's built-in "cuss-checker" you can prevent
        obscene messages from being posted - or allow them if you wish!
     >> Users can read the wall forward (newest messages appear at the
        bottom so it's all shown in consecutive order) or backward (new
        messages appear at the top, the way some other walls do it).

      For all its configurability and its many features, Mystic Messages
  remains one of the best-kept secrets we have (not sure why). It's VERY
  inexpensive, offers INCREDIBLE easy-to-use global colors, REAL GRAFFITI,
  and tons of options for the sysop... yet it's very SIMPLE to use!

  Look for the latest version as: MMESS*.ZIP where "*" is the version.
