Version 2.1 beta - December 10, 1996

All the WEB power you need, all in one module! 

NOW SUPPORTS BOTH GALACTICOMM'S ICO AND VIRCOM'S MAJOR TCP/IP

 --------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Get Professional WEB Power!

  DialSoft proudly presents WEB Blaster Pro!, the successor to our
  very own WEB Blaster!

  If you own WEB Blaster you already know the great features it has
  to offer.  With that in mind, add hit & byte counters, subdirectories,
  multi-homing, top 10 lists, and more!  This is our first beta release
  of our all new product!  

  When you install WBPro you will see the power of this module.  How?
  Well, WBPro is designed to install on your system with NO crazy
  setup procedure.  Simply run the INSTALL, add the module page and
  that's it!  You don't have to configure any paths, settings, file
  names, or anything!  We guarantee that there  will be no other module
  that installs this easily!  

  If that's not enough, this module is also NO MSG compliant.  NO MSG 
  is DialSoft's new standard of modules.  What does that mean?  All 
  options you would normally see in level 3 & level4 are moved online
  so you can make changes to your configuration that take effect 
  immediately!  No downtime!  DialSoft wants to see your system up 
  longer! 

  Check out the following URL's for an example of WB Pro's features:

   http://www.jungle.net/wbpusers.htm   (realtime userlist with links)
   http://www.jungle.net/wbptop10.htm   (top 10 lists, auto generated)
   http://www.jungle.net/userlist.htm   (directory of user homepages)
   http://www.dialsoft.com/banner.htm   (example of our BANNER features)


  You may run WEB Blaster & WEB Blaster Pro simultaneously on 
  your system!

 --------------------------------------------------------------------

*** New Features for beta 2.0:
  
  - Now supports BANNERS!  Add advertisement banners on ANY of your
    web pages!  Users may use banners too!  A great way to bring
    in some extra cash by selling advertisements!  (Banners are
    random, and can be changed/updated online!)

  - Now supports FTP'ing into ANY multi-homed domain!  All problems
    are now over!

  - Many thanks to the SysOps who have reported problems! We love you!

 --------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Current Features:

   find WBPro's interface the easiest to use.

     DEL ... Delete files
     REN ... Rename files

   All commands support wildcards.  Switches like /S, /W, /Ax, etc
   are also supported!  Where will you find power like this?! Only 
   in DialSoft modules!

 - Several commands for WEB Page statistics:
  
     stats ... lists all the pages & directories that have been hit
               on your system.  Shows how many hits the page has 
               received, and how many bytes have been transferred.
 
     hits .... gives a monthly breakdown of how many hits/bytes
               a page has had.

     space ... Show you how much space is available in your directory.


     report .. Shows a detailed report of all the users who have
               web pages,  many details, here's an example:


       UserId: XynamaX                        Page created on: 10-08-96
       =========================================================
                 Domain: www.xynamax.com
           Sub-directory:
          Directory Path: TCPWEB2\WEBPAGES.046
                   Title: XynamaX Land!
             Description: Home of the almight X.
           Email Address: xynamax@jungle.net
           Active: YES
       Show in directory: YES
        Show in userlist: YES
         Email from list: YES
        Can make subdirs: YES
             File status: 56 total files
        Directory status: 8 directories

              Total hits: 47
       Bytes transferred: 1,385,629

  
 - Users may choose their own directory, or be assigned one.
   Sysops choose this in "config1".

 - Supports Multi-homing features.  Add hosts online instantly!

 - Hit & byte counters!  NO CGI required!

 - Auto generates an HTML file with the top10 hit sites hosted
   by your system!

 - Users can enter edit options for their home page, such as:
     . Description (for the directory)
     . Whether or not their page is listed in the directory.
     . Whether or not their page is listed in the real-time userlist.
     . Whether or not people can send them Email from the userlist.
     . A custom Email address if they have several Email addresses

   All these options are editable in a Full Screen Data entry session.
   No silly menuing system, easy and to the point.

 - All security features controlled by KEYS.

 - Sysops can edit user settings, such as:
     . All user settings mentioned about.
     . Maximum file space user may use.
     . ACTIVATE/DEACTIVATE a users home page ONLINE!

   Once again, these are all in a Data Entry session.

 - Generates several files:

     DIRECTORY - A list of all the WEB Pages created on your system.
                 Users can decide if they want their page listed in
                 the directory in their options.  Sysops can define
                 an *UNLIMITED* number of directories, users are 
                 placed in directories by holding certain KEYS.
 
     USERLIST  - A list of ALL the users ONLINE your system at the
                 given time!  It also includes links to all the users
                 homepages if they created them!
                 Soon: Direct Email from userlist

     TOP10LIST - A list of the top10 sites managed on your system!
                 Does a daily & all-time list!

     The USERLIST is completely configurable. The sysop can choose
     a combination of the following fields to create his/her 
     custom userlist:
     UserID, Baud Rate, Current Module, Age, Sex, City/State, Time Online
     Class, and more!

     Check out http://www.jungle.net/userlist.htm  for an example!

     Both of these filenames are Sysop configurable.
     Sysops may also specify the MINIMUM key required to be shown
     on the userlist.  Some SysOps asked me to add this so that
     their DEMO users don't show up.  Done.

 - The file utilities are 100% secure.  Users can NOT overwrite
   any files except those in their directory. Guaranteed.

 - Pages are automatically disabled when:
     . The owner loses the key required for a web page
     . The owner goes over his/her space quota
     . The sysop deactivates the page.

     All response messages for disabled pages are configurable!

 - TEMPLATES!  Templates are 100% compatible with WEB Blaster's 
   template features. All templates are loaded at startup, and can be
   reloaded at anytime after startup. You may edit, delete, rename 
   template files online.  Creating the templates is simple as well. 
   You create a template file with a list of questions for your users
   to answer, in the same file, you list a HTML document for the template
   to use.  You can specify the name, description, and KEY required to
   use any template.  Here's an actual example of a .WBT file 
   (WEB Blaster Template). This file is named REGISTRY.WBT:

   ;All lines that begin with ';' are comments. (like REM in DOS)
   [setup]
   template_name=Registry
   template_desc=This is a simple registry-type WEB page.
   template_key=DEMO

   [questions]
   NAME=What is your name?
   AGE=What is your age?
   CITY=What city do you live in?
   GROWUP=What do you want to do when you grow up?

   [html]
   <HTML>
   <H1>This is _NAME_'s home page!</H1>
   <P>
   Welcome to my home page!  I am _AGE_ years old and I live in _CITY_!
   <P>
   When I grow up, I want to _GROWUP_!
   </HTML>
   ;end of file

 - Templates are 100% configurable.  Make them any way you like, add 
   graphics, add links, add anything you like!  You can even edit the
   templates online using the Full Screen Editor!  This version supports
   up to 25 templates.

 - Backups!  Let's say a user created a template.  Then he/she created
   another template, overwriting their old one.  What happens if they
   don't like the new one?  With WEB Blaster, they can easily retrieve 
   their old web page, without having to fill out their old template
   all over again.  WEB Blaster will automatically create backups 
   of their web pages everytime they create a new one using a template.
  
 - Option to check for profanities in directory names and templates.

 - SysOps can now easily edit/change their user-listing files online.
   Instead of using CNF options, all files (userlist, directory, etc)
   are controlled by file templates.

 - Now supports easy accounting!  No need to specify the number of days
   before a user's page expires.  Why?  Because WEB Blaster will 
   automatically disable a users page when his/her account expires
   and is switched to a lower class!

 - Grace periods!  What happens if a user's page is disabled, but that
   user never pays for the WEB page access again?  Their WEB Page files
   are just eating up hard drive space on your BBS!  Now, a Sysop may
   give users a grace period.  If a user fails to renew his access in
   the grace period, his/her page is deleted.  Users are notified at 
   logon time with how many days they have before their page is deleted.

 - Since users may have several Email addresses, WEB Blaster Pro let's the
   user type in the address at which they want to receive mail!

 - Quick & responsive customer support.  
   
 - All suggestions taken into account!
