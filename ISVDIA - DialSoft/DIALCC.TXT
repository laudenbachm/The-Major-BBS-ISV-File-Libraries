Chit Chatters v2.0
Chit Chatters furnishes your system with up to 150 Global Chat Channels!
Users may use these channels to chat with other users from almost anywhere
on your system! (Anywhere Global Commands work, Chit Chatters work too!)

Chit Chatters is 100% compatible with The Major BBS 6.25 and Worldgroup
1.x and 2.x!

Chit Chatters comes with a FREE 14 day FULLY WORKING demo!  If you would
like to purchase a copy of Chit Chatters, it may be purchased from DialSoft

Understanding Terminology:
--------------------------
As you have already read, Chit Chatters allows you to define up to 150 Global
Chat CHANNELS.   Each channel is tunable to a FREQUENCY between
the values of 1 and 2147483647.  To be able to CHAT with other users via
Chit Chatters, all users who want to Chat with each other need to:
  a) Select a channel to CHAT ON
  b) Tune their selected channel to the SAME FREQUENCY as other users
      they would like to chat with!
In actuality, the CHANNEL is nothing more than a Sysop Definable 
GLOBAL COMMAND -- a command who's purpose is CHATTING!

You may think of a Chit Chatter CHANNEL as behaving like a variable
frequency WALKIE TALKIE.  Why?  Walkie Talkies are devices used
by (for example) security guards in malls.  When security guards want to
TALK to one another, they press a button on their walkie talkie, speak
into the microphone, and the walkie talkie transmits the sound at a certain
FREQUENCY!  Some walkie talkies have multiple "frequency" selections.
That is, there can be (for example) 10 security guards, 5 of whom are tuned
to frequency 950 Mhz, and the other 5 may be tuned to 970 Mhz.  The 
people at 950 Mhz WILL NOT be able to communicate with the people at 970 Mhz
and vice versa.  But they WILL be able to communicate with those people who
are on the same frequency as them!

Based on the Walkie Talkie analogy above, lets equate the components of
Chit Chatters to Walkie Talkies:

1) You may define up to 150 Chit Chatter CHANNELS.  Each CHANNEL may
     be considered a separate walkie talkie -- with one IMPORTANT difference:
     Unlike walkie talkies, tuning DIFFERENT Chit Chatter Channels to the
     SAME frequency does NOT allow communication between the two different
     Chit Chatter Channels.  Each Chit Chatter Channel is 100% independent
     every other Chit Chatter Channel, regardless of what frequency they may
     be set at! (If Mike has his !! channel tuned to frequency 100 and Kathy
     has her (( channel tuned to frequency 100 as well, Mike and Kathy
     WILL NOT be able to chat with each other via those two different
     CHANNELS!  They must tune the SAME CHANNEL to the SAME FREQUENCY).

2) To chat on a channel, users must set the SAME CHANNEL to the SAME
     FREQUENCY (and there are over 2 billion frequencies per channel).

3) To talk on a channel, a user need only type the Chit Chatter CHANNEL NAME
     followed by the message.  This is the equivalent of PUSHING THE BUTTON
     on a Walkie Talkie.

4) All users who are on the Channel and at the same frequency as the user in
    step 3 will see the CHAT TEXT!


Logging on for the FIRST TIME:
------------------------------
If you have just installed Chit Chatters on your BBS, any user that has
access to at least one Chit Chatter Channel (i.e. has the Key Needed to
use at least 1 Chit Chatter channel you have defined in DIALCC.CFG) will
see the Chit Chatters New User Welcome Message.  The default message is
a LARGE PURPLE BOX.  It has been designed like this in the hopes that it
will STAND OUT -- catch the reader's attention.  In this box, you are
informed that you have access to an exciting new module called Chit Chatters,
and that this module allows you to GLOBALLY CHAT with other on-line users
from almost ANYWHERE on the BBS.  You will also be told that to learn more
about this module, type CHITCHAT from any BBS prompt!

Commands:
---------
CHITCHAT - Typed by ITSELF, this is the command to pull up the MAIN Chit
Chatters introduction screen.  In this screen, you will see a brief
explanation of what Chit Chatters can do along with an example of how to use
a Chit Chatter Channel.  In the middle of the screen will be a listing of all
Chit Chatter Channels you have ACCESS to.  At the bottom of the screen, you
will see (in addition to some other information), a line that says:

CHITCHAT ON/OFF/DEF -	Turn ON, OFF, or RESET TO DEFAULT 
                        all your Chit Chatters

This means that if you type:
----------------------------
CHITCHAT ON -	You will turn ON ALL your Chit Chatter Channels to their
                last known frequency settings.
CHITCHAT OFF-	You will turn OFF ALL your Chit Chatter Channels to their
                current frequency settings.
CHITCHAT DEF-	You will reset all your Chit Chatter Channels to BOTH their
                default frequencies and their default MODES.  (DIALCC.CFG
                lets you configure the DEFAULT MODE of each channel
                as ON or OFF by specifying a POSITIVE FRQUENCY if
                a channel's default mode is ON, NEGATIVE for OFF.

CHITPLUS - This command pulls up a MENU of Chit Chatters Advanced User
options.  The commands listed in this menu vary depending on what KEYS a user
holds.  (Some of the descriptions for each command vary as well for the same
reason.  This will be explained shortly).  The CHITPLUS menu may display the
following commands:
  CHITCHAT, CHITFREQ, CHITLIST, CHITLON, CHITLOF, CHITCFG, and CHITPLUS

CHITFREQ - When typed alone, this command displays which Chit Chatter
channels you have access to, and what frequencies each channel is tuned too
(or the word 'OFF' if a Channel is turned off).  For those who have the key
defined in CNF LEVEL 3, SEEFREQ, they may type CHITFREQ <userid> to pull up
the Channel/Frequency settings of any other on-line user. (They will also see
additional DESCRIPTION information about this CHITFREQ capability in the
CHITPLUS menu.)

CHITLIST - This command lists the Channels and Frequency settings of ALL 
on-line users.  The output looks very similar to the CHITFREQ command, except
for the fact that CHITFREQ shows the output of only 1 user at a time whereas
CHITLIST shows the output of ALL on-line users.   To use this command, you
must have the SEEFREQ key (CNF Level 3).

CHITLON - This is the command used to configure each user's Chit Chatters
LOGON MESSAGE modes.  Depending on what you have configured in CNF
Level 4, the CHITLON may not have all "modes" available.  For that matter, if
you have DISABLED Chit Chatters LOGON messages, this command will not
exist.   There are TWO MODES:  Receive Mode and Send Mode

Receive Mode - ON or OFF: This mode allows users to configure whether or
not they want to RECEIVE notification of other users who log in and are tuned
to at least 1 identical Chit Chatter Channel at the same Frequency.
	Example:
	John is on-line with the following Chit Chatter Channel settings:
		Channel		Frequency
                [[                  123
                ]]                  80002
                ;;                  1
                --                  900

	Mary logs on.  She's got the following settings:
		Channel		Frequency
                [[                  25
                ]]                  80002
                ;;                  7239434
                --                  900

	If John has his Chit Chatters Logon Receive mode ON, he will be
	notified that Mary has just joined him in the "]] and --" channels!
        If his notifications are OFF, he will not receive any notification!

Send Mode - PUBLIC or PRIVATE:  This mode, if not disabled in CNF, allows
users to configure whether or not other on-line users can be NOTIFIED of
their arrival!  PUBLIC mode means that other users are allowed to see Chit
Chatters LOGON Notification.  PRIVATE mode means that other users are NOT
allowed to see Chit Chatters Logon Notification - with ONE NOTABLE EXCEPTION:
Those who hold the CNF Level 3 Key 'SEEPRIV' will be allowed to see Logon
Notifications of users who set their SEND MODE to PRIVATE.
       Thus, in the ABOVE EXAMPLE, if Mary had her SEND mode set to
       PRIVATE, if John didn't have the SEEPRIV key, he would not have
       seen the Chit Chatters notification of Mary's arrival, regardless
       of the fact that he may have had his RECEIVE MODE as ON.

CHITLOF - This command is identical in every respect to the CHITLON
command except that it applies to LOGOFF notifications rather than LOGON
notifications.

CHITCFG - This command allows you to perform an on-line RELOAD of
your DIALCC.CFG file.  This enables you to on-line modify all your Chit
Chatter Channel COMMAND NAMES, KEY NEEDED, and DEFAULT
FREQUENCY settings!  To clarify, CHITCFG only performs a RELOAD of
the DIALCC.CFG file!  It does not provide any editing capabilities!  (You
need to edit the file on an OFF-LINE system and upload it to the BBS
machine). To use this command, you must have the CNF Level 3 key
CFGKEY.  A few notes about this command:
  1)  Typing CHITCFG by itself provides basic information about the
      command.
  2)  To perform a RELOAD of DIALCC.CFG, type: CHITCFG GO
  3)  If there are any errors in your new DIALCC.CFG file:
          a) Chit Chatters will try and provide you with the reason for
             the error(s)
          b) No new settings will be used!  (i.e. Whatever your settings
             were before typing 'CHITCFG GO' will remain the same).
   4) You may receive a WARNING Message if you INCREASE the
      number Chit Chatter Channels defined in the 'NUMCHAN=x'
      line of DIALCC.CFG.   Your new settings WILL take effect;
      however, you will not have your additional channels available
      until the BBS resets.  The reason for this is:
        Chit Chatters allocates all its MEMORY during BBS INIT.
        While it is possible to allocate additional memory while the
        BBS is up, it reduces the risk of BBS crashes by NOT doing so.

        Example:
        If the BBS comes up with 10 Chit Chatter channels defined and you
        modify your DIALCC.CFG file to contain 15 channels, when you
        type CHITCFG GO, only the first 10 channels will be read in!  The
        next time the BBS resets, you will have all 15 Chit Chatter channels
        available!


And finally.... Chatting with Chit Chatters!!!
----------------------------------------------
To explain how to Chat w/ Chit Chatters, a series of Scenarios will be
presented. Please assume the following for the next discussion:

There are 4 Chit Chatter Channels defined on your BBS:

Channel Name		Key Needed		Default Frequency
     !!                    NORMAL                 -100
     ((                    NORMAL                  50
     **                    STAFF                   5551212
     $$                    SYSOP                   100

- Those who have the NORMAL key can chat on Chit Chatters: !! and ((
- Those who have the STAFF key can chat on Chit Chatter: **
- Those who have the SYSOP key can chat on Chit Chatters: $$
- Those who have ALL 3 keys can chat on Chit Chatters: !! ((  ** and $$

Lets assume the following users are on-line:
Mike		who has the NORMAL key
Mary		who has the NORMAL key
Helper		who has the NORMAL and STAFF keys
Sysop		who has the NORMAL, STAFF and SYSOP keys
Cosysop	who has the NORMAL, STAFF and SYSOP keys

Everybody above can chat on the !! and (( channels!
Helper, Sysop and Cosysop can chat on the ** channel.
Sysop and Cosysop can chat on the $$ channel!

Scenario #1:
------------
Mike and Mary want to carry on a private conversation on the !! channel.
They decide to tune that channel to a frequency of 890123.  To do so,
they each type:    !!=890123

Now they can Chat on the !! channel!  To do so, they simply need to type:
!!<message>.  For example, assume Mike types: !!Hi Mary, how are you?
The output that BOTH Mary and Mike will see is:
[!!] (890123) Mike: Hi Mary, how are you?

Mary responds by typing: !!I'm fine!  This is a great way to chat!
Mike and Mary BOTH see:
[!!] (890123) Mary: I'm fine!  This is a great way to chat!

A few notes about the above:
1) Notice that the Channel the two users are talking on appears inside
   BRACKETS on the LEFTMOST PORTION of the output line.  ([!!] in this case).
2) The next field displayed is the FREQUENCY that the channel being chatted
   on is tuned to.  (890123 in this case).
3) The next field is the USER-ID sending the message
4) Finally the MESSAGE itself is displayed.

Scenario #2 - Mike gets Fancy:
------------------------------
Being a curious person, Mike plays around with Chit Chatters.  He types !!
by itself.  Instantly he sees a list of all users who are tuned to the !!
channel at frequency 890123.  In this case, only Mary and Mike are in that
list.  One thing he sees however, is a note at the bottom of the list.  It
says to type !!? for additional information.  He does so and learns there
are other features in Chit Chatters.  

Case 1: Mike types:
!!>Mary Check this out!  
The output is:
[!!] (890123) From Mike to (Mary): Check this out!

Case 2:  Mike types:
!!ga thinks Chit Chatters should be on EVERY BBS!
The output is:
[!!] (890123) Mike thinks Chit Chatters should be on EVERY BBS!

Case 3: Mike types:
!!dice 25,999
The output is:
[!!] (890123) Mike rolls <25> 999-sided dice and gets: 961, 356, 895, 395,
178, 565, 224, 323, 700, 380, 237, 547, 93, 359, 162, 414, 867, 585, 321,
338, 404, 459, 134, 420, 488, for a total of: >>10805<<

What happened in Cases 1, 2 and 3?
Case 1:  DIRECTED MESSAGES  -  Mike directed his message to Mary
         by typing the Chit Chatter Channel Name (!!) followed by the
         > (Greater Than) Symbol, followed by the user-id, and then
         finally the message!  (Note: You may specify a PARTIAL or
         COMPLETE user-id!)

Case 2:  GENERIC ACTIONS - Mike sent a GENERIC ACTION on the
         (!!) channel by typing the phrase 'ga' after the !!
         Chit Chatter Channel.

Case 3:  DICE ROLLING - Mike used the Chit Chatters DICE ROLL feature
         to roll 25 dice (each w/ 999 sides) on the !! channel.  This feature
         is useful for users participating in on-line Roll Playing Games.

In all 3 cases, the only users who saw output (in this case) were Mike and
Mary. Why?  They were the only ones tuned to the !! channel at frequency
890123.

Scenario #3 - Other features:
-----------------------------
1) Those who have the CNF Level 3 key SEEFREQ may type any Chit Chatter
Channel name followed by the # symbol to see a list of what frequencies all
on-line users are tuned too on the Chit Chatter Channel selected.

For example, if Sysop typed:  !!#
The output may look like:
                         Users on Chit Chatter: !!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Mike				- 890123
	Mary				- 890123
	Helper				- [OFF]
	Sysop				- 100
        Cosysop                         - 100

               Type !!? for a menu of additional options
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Mike decides to type: !!=off.  The next time Sysop types !!#,
    the output would be:
                         Users on Chit Chatter: !!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Mike				- [OFF]
	Mary				- 890123
	Helper				- [OFF]
	Sysop				- 100
        Cosysop                         - 100

               Type !!? for a menu of additional options
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) If Mike then types: !!=def, his !! channel will be set to the DEFAULT
    FREQUENCY of the !! channel.  Because the default frequency for
    !! is negative, Mike's !! channel will be OFF. 

4) If Mike decides to type !!=on, his !! channel will be turned ON at
    frequency 100!  Thus, if Sysop then types: !!#, the output will be:
                         Users on Chit Chatter: !!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Mike				- 100
	Mary				- 890123
	Helper				- [OFF]
	Sysop				- 100
        Cosysop                         - 100

               Type !!? for a menu of additional options
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5) If Mike then types !!=411, his !! channel will be tuned to frequency
    411.  If Sysop then types !!#, the output will be:
                         Users on Chit Chatter: !!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Mike				- 411
	Mary				- 890123
	Helper				- [OFF]
	Sysop				- 100
        Cosysop                         - 100

               Type !!? for a menu of additional options
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


In a Nutshell (Using !! as a sample channel):
---------------------------------------------
!!=off	will turn the !! channel OFF at its current frequency
	(!!=0 is a shortcut for typing !!=off)

!!=on	will turn the !! channel ON at the LAST FREQUENCY it was set to

!!=def	will set the !! channel to its DEFAULT FREQUENCY and MODE!

!!	will display a list of all users who are tuned to the !! channel at
        the same frequency as YOU.

!!#	will display a list of all users who have access to the !! channel
	and what frequency they have that channel tuned to (if their !!
	channel is ON)

!!<message>	will display <message> on the !! channel

!!>(uid) <msg>  will display a DIRECTED MESSAGE to a user

!!ga <msg>	will display a GENERIC ACTION on the !! channel

!!dice x,y	will roll 'x' number of 'y' sided dice on the !! channel

!!?	will display a MENU of SOME or ALL the above options
	(It depends on what KEYS a user has.  For example, !!# 
	 is only displayed to users with the SEEFREQ key)

Information about INVISIBLE users:
----------------------------------
Chit Chatters has been designed to allow INVISIBLE users to CHAT on
Chit Chatter channels with both VISIBLE and INVISIBLE users.  This
feature allows 'lurking sysops' (for example) to easily chat with SOME
on-line users while not letting the majority of users know that a Sysop
is lurking.  Take the !! channel for a moment.  Assume user id's Mike
and Sysop both have their !! channel tuned to the same frequency:

If Sysop in INVISIBLE and Mike (who doesn't have access to see
invisible users) types !! to see a list of users on the !! channel, Mike
will NOT see Sysop in the user list.  However, if Sysop chats on the
!! channel, Mike WILL SEE any chat dialogue Sysop sends.

For that matter, Sysop will be able to DIRECT MESSAGES to Mike;
however, Mike will NOT be able to DIRECT MESSAGES to Sysop
(until Sysop goes VISIBLE).

Thus, the only way a normal user can tell if an INVISIBLE SYSOP is
tuned to any of his/her Chit Chatter Channels is if the INVISIBLE SYSOP
types something on the channel!  Thus, Chit Chatters enables Sysops to
safely monitor the activity in Chit Chatter Channels without normal users
knowing this is happening.

Some Final Thoughts:
--------------------
1) One of the most frequently asked questions about Chit Chatters is: 
    Q:	Can users /INVITE and /FORGET 'annoying/problematic'
	users from their Chit Chatter channels
    A:	No, because:  Each Chit Chatter channel is tunable to over
	2 billion frequencies!  If a group of users want to "get away"
	from another user, they can collectively /p each other to switch
	to another frequency!  The probability of the annoying user
	guessing the NEW FREQUENCY is very very slim!

2) Something I failed to make clear in this entire document is that users
can carry on multiple conversations by chatting in MULTIPLE CHIT
CHATTER CHANNELS!  If you recall, Chit Chatter Channel names
are nothing more than Global Commands!  Users can use any Global
Commands they have access to.

Restating sample data from above, based on the following:
	Channel Name		Key Needed		Default Frequency
             !!                    NORMAL                 -100
             ((                    NORMAL                  50
             **                    STAFF                   5551212
             $$                    SYSOP                   100

	Lets assume the following users are on-line:
	Mike		who has the NORMAL key
	Mary		who has the NORMAL key
	Helper		who has the NORMAL and STAFF keys
	Sysop		who has the NORMAL, STAFF and SYSOP keys
	Cosysop		who has the NORMAL, STAFF and SYSOP keys

Thus:
- Mike and Mary can carry simultaneous conversations in both the !! and ((
  channels!
- Helper can carry simultaneous conversations in the !! (( and ** channels!
- Sysop and Cosysop can  carry simultaneous conversations in the !! (( ** and
  $$ channels!

A note about World Group:
-------------------------
Chit Chatters currently operates in Ascii/Ansi mode only!   C/S users who are
on-line will not "conflict" with A/A users.  They will simply be considered
as either having all their channels OFF, or as not having access to Chit
Chatters (until they drop to A/A mode).
