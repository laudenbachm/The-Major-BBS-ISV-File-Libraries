West Coast Creations is based in Vancouver, BC, Canada.  You can 
contact us via the support board at:

              (604) 739-3714 (22 14.4 Sportster)
              (604) 739-3712 (3  24.4 V.Fast)
              (604) 739-3764 (3  28.8 USRobotics Couriers)

We are also available via Telnet at:

              204.244.18.12       (dsoe.com)

If you have a slower connection, try telnetting to:

              204.244.18.129      (unix.dsoe.com)

and then login as user 'bbs' with the password 'bbs'.  This will let our 
unix computer handle the slower internet connection thereby providing you
with a relatively faster connection (Linux does a better job of handling
slow, unreliable internet connections than the TCP/IP stack for MajorBBS 
does).

Further contact information is available in the release notes associated 
with each of the products.
