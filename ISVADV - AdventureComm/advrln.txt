Time and Date Changer v1.50   Newest Version   $35.00
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
   v1.50     01/27/98

1. Added a YES/NO option to display to the Audit Trail or not, I got
   a request for this command because people where using this in
   a popular Mud game to regenerate monsters to drop items.  He used
   it over 1000 times in an hour and got alot of items for his members
   on his bbs system.  Although it is possible to do this, you have
   to be very careful.  Some games save when people exit and if for
   some reason the date is a few days ahead and it saves there character,
   in like a space game, They will not be able to enter and it will
   say there ship was destroyed.  Just have to watch your users in other
   modules basically if you are using this module for that purpose.
   That I know of all Muds save differently so you should be ok changing
   time or date inside these.
2. Added a new CNF option for a sysop to decide what to make the lead
   characters (switch) for time changes.  Set to -ct but up to you now.
3. Added a new CNF option for a sysop to decide what to make the lead
   characters (switch) for date changes.  Set to -cd but up to you now.
4. Added a new CNF option for a sysop to decide what to make the lead
   characters (switch) for time & date to be displayed.  Set to -tnd
   but you can change it, alot of global packages use =td or -td do
   not make them the same as those if you are running one that displays
   the time and date, if you do you will either have a catastro or a GP.
   As of now this is the only module I know that uses -tnd.
5. After taking over EzSoft's Line of modules, if you were running EzSoft
   Clock you need to email me directly, contact info is above.  You will
   receive a free copy of the Time and Date Changer with proof of owner
   ship. Basically a version number and an actcode will tell me if you
   owned it or not.
6. Modified the -tnd command greatly, also changed from 2 globals to 1
   to show the time and date.
7. Other misc. changes to colors.
8. Made the Time and Date Changer 3.0 Dos compatible.

   v1.35     08/23/97
1. Added a write to the audit trail whenever the Time or Date is
   changed from within the menu or with the global commands.
2. Added a new CNF option to set for people that you want to be able
   to change the system time and date globally.
3. Added 2 more globals to allow a sysop or a person that has the
   appropriate key to change the system time or system date within
   any module.  To prevent cheating in some modules, I recommend making
   this key different than the one you set to go into the module.  The
   reason is some of the Muds are based on time and\or dates for specific
   items and monsters to regenerate.  An Op can cheat very easy making
   monsters regenerate within seconds instead of their appropriate times.
   It also might be possible to disable this global from the other
   modules CNF options by putting it in as one of the globals not to
   allow.
4. Seperated the versions, now each individual platform has a seperate
   version.  In preparation of implementing a C/S side and possibly a
   HTML side.
5. Changed the price to $35.00 from $19.95 because of the addition of
   global commands that allow you to change the system time and date
   globally.  All previous owners get this version at no extra cost.

   memory now.
