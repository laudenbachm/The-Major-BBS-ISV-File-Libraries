+ ADV Advertiser -                                                
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $50.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Advertiser allows you to display ads to your users while they are online. 
  It can select ads which you have created and display them at regular 
  intervals you configure. You control who views the ads and who doesn't see
  them; there is a key for your staff not to see the ads if you wish, and 
  you can configure the ads so they are broadcast to only a selected 
  audience.  This audience can be selected to be only males, only females,
  only adults, only minors, to see an ad only once a day, to display only on
  a certain channel range, to display only during prime time hours you 
  configure, and to be broadcast only to one random user selected at 
  broadcast time. Advertiser allows you to charge companies to offer their
  products and services to your users, and you can charge premium prices 
  for ads broadcast during prime time, greatly increasing your 
  profitability.  Ads can be added, removed and configured while the system 
  is running for maximum flexibility. All of the options can be configured 
  in CNF to suit your needs. Advertiser can even keep a record of how often 
  each ad is displayed so you can charge for each display if desired.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV AFK -
  MBBS, WG 1.X , WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $40.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Allows users to tell others that they are away from their keyboards, and 
  to find out when others are away and return. Global command makes telling 
  others and checking on them a snap. When checking other users, you do not 
  have to type the full handle, but only part of it like the /p page 
  command. Can be used with actions in the Entertainment Teleconference, 
  or without actions in the standard Teleconference to let users in your 
  Teleconference channel know your status with the same global command. Can 
  also show the user's location as "Away From Keyboard" in user listings 
  when users use a global user listing command if you don't use the 
  Teleconference actions. A must-have module for all multi-line systems. 
  All  options and text blocks are fully Sysop configurable in CNF.
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Birthday Announcer -                                             C/S
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $50.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This birthday lister displays a birthday ANSI drawing and birthday wishes 
  to everyone at log-on if a user has a birthday. The user whose birthday is
  listed is randomly selected at each log-on so that everyone has a chance 
  to be recognized on their special day. Birthday also shows upcoming 
  birthdays. It can send Email to users on their birthdays, with gift 
  credits or days in class (Worldgroup version) if you wish. Includes an 
  option to not show user's ages. All options and text blocks are CNF 
  configurable. Worldgroup version includes both C/S and A/A interfaces.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Busy Notifier -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X $40.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Tells you when you can page someone who is "busy" and can't be paged. You 
  are notified as soon as they are no longer busy or they log off the 
  system. You don't even have to type the user's full handle; just part of
  the handle like the /p <user-id> paging command. It even continues to 
  check to see if you can be notified if you are "busy" when your 
  notification arrives. All options and text blocks are configurable by 
  the Sysop in CNF. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Call Back -                                                      C/S
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $40.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Lets you limit users without the key you choose from re-logging on within 
  the amount of time you choose. You can set a delay of up to 2 hours. Ideal
  for keeping users with a limit per call from logging off or re-logging 
  and coming back right before their time expires, freeing a line for 
  someone else. "Prime time" option allows you to set when the module runs 
  for during peak times only.  All options and text blocks are Sysop 
  configurable in CNF. Delays are recorded in the Audit Trail. The 
  Worldgroup version works with both C/S and A/A users.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Class Change -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $40.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Gives you a global command to switch new users into a desired trial class
  for the desired number of days and at the same time optionally post 
  credits. A great convenience to the Sysop in that now you can do 
  everything in one simple global command and you can configure the number 
  of days that get posted as well as the credits so Class Change handles it
  all for you. You configure who can use Class Change by key, and all 
  options and text blocks in CNF. Class changes are recorded in the Audit 
  Trail.
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Colorize -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $40.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Allows your users to insert color and ASCII extended characters into their
  messages. Works globally for input such as whispers, the line editor (but
  NOT full screen editor), pages, the registry, and so on. Users can color 
  their text and background, create special effects such as blinking text
  and reverse video, and put extended characters into their input. Coloring 
  text and background, special effects and extended characters are all keyed
  individually so you control who gets access to these commands. The 
  commands are used with characters that you can change in CNF. On-line 
  help that you can edit included. Colorize even strips out redundant ANSI 
  codes so your users can make the largest possible message. Now includes 
  lower ASCII characters such as the heart and "beep" characters, and gives 
  you the ability to turn each lower character ON or OFF.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Credit Alert -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $40.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Tells users when they log-on if their credits or days left in class are 
  running low. Also can alert on-line users who are running low on credits 
  if their class uses credits, and can alert those who have a limit per call
  when they are running out of time left. All options and text blocks are 
  configurable by the Sysop in CNF. The Worldgroup version alerts both C/S
  and A/A users, and gives the option to send Email alerts to your users 
  too.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Credits -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $50.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Credits allows you to define up to 5 classes which you would like to have
  receive free credits each month. You can specify how many free credits 
  each class gets. Then during the midnight cleanup routine on the day you 
  specify of each month the classes are posted free credits. However, their
  total free credits will never exceed the amount they are to be posted; so 
  for example, if a  class is to receive 3600 free credits each month, and 
  they have 1800 free credits left from the previous month, they will start
  out the month with only 3600 free credits rather than 5400. They will 
  still keep any paid credits. Great for giving your users the ability to 
  play games and use premium services with a limit, and they may even wish 
  to purchase more credits as a result!  You configure all options such as
  class names, credit amounts, and the day of each month to post and 
  balance credits on.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Demo Clean -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $40.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Demo Clean allows you to get rid of unused accounts easily and 
  automatically. You configure which accounts are deleted (those who lack a
  key you specify), and how many days of inactivity before they are tagged 
  for kill. Then during midnight cleanup, these users are tagged for kill.
  A message can be placed both in the Audit Trail and in a text file telling
  you of the tag, allowing you the opportunity to remove the tag if you 
  wish. If you don't remove the tag, the account will be deleted at the next
  cleanup. Accounts which are protected are not tagged for kill.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Feedback -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X $40.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Provides a convenient place for users to leave feedback to your BBS staff.
  You configure who can leave feedback by key, as well as who receives the 
  feedback in their Email, and the program text blocks.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV FreeLine -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $40.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Keeps DEMO users from tying up your lines. If all lines are in use and 
  DEMO users are logged on, FreeLine hangs up on a DEMO user after telling 
  him he should pay up to avoid this hassle. Keeps a line free for your 
  paying users. Now upgraded so you can choose not to have all lines 
  checked, as well as how often the program checks the lines. Sysop 
  configures which users get bumped off and which are safe by key, and what
  the hang-up message says. FreeLine allows you to configure which lines 
  are checked, and logs off the DEMO user who has been on the longest time.
  Records both warnings and log-offs in the Audit Trail. Logs off both C/S 
  and A/A users.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Global Post -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $40.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If you've ever had your system down for a day and had your users complain 
  about losing a day they paid for Global Post will end that headache. It 
  allows posting of days in class and/or credits to all users in a selected 
  class. Now you can keep your users happy and give them the full number of
  days they've paid for without a major hassle by using this module. 
  Multiple classes can be posted to simultaneously using the simple global 
  commands. Also great for Christmas gifts, special promotions, etc. Also 
  allows you to globally set how many days in class all users in desired 
  classes have and how many credits all users in desired classes have using
  global commands. This allows you to set the credits of all users to 0 if 
  you are going to a days only system. All options and text blocks are 
  Sysop configurable in CNF. Postings are recorded in the Audit Trail.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ ADV Globals -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $80.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This is a package of global commands that you won't be able to live 
  without after you've seen it. Includes macros, Who's Online, screen type
  and mode, instant log-off, page console and all Sysops who are online, 
  chat channels, telegrams, transfer credits and days in class, log-on 
  notices, a switch to not be bothered in the Editor, and many more, 
  including colorize input. Also included are many Sysop commands such as 
  give/take user key including negative keys, switch class, suspend user 
  with automatic unsuspend, post credits and days in class, extend a user's 
  time on-line, and many neat features like the ability to page a user 
  whose page mode is set to OFF and the ability to turn off a user's 
  "Busy". We have made many enhancements to invisibility and the Sysop 
  commands in this version, and users can choose whether to show their ages
  to others in the Who's Online display. All commands are keyed, with 
  command strings you define.  Very customizable with many options 
  configurable by the Sysop in CNF.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Invisible -                                                      C/S
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $40.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Allows Sysops to turn any user invisible, and back to normal again using 
  a global command. Also turns desired users who don't have a key invisible
  at log-on. It also automatically  updates the visibility of users whose
  access changes while on-line, so if a user's class changes he is made 
  invisible or uninvisible automatically! Keeps new users from annoying 
  paying members and  vice versa. All options and text blocks are 
  configurable by the  Sysop in CNF. Use of the global command is recorded 
  in the Audit Trail. The Worldgroup version works with C/S and A/A users.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Lines -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $80.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Lines allows you to have your system check for the lines filling up during
  prime time hours you configure. If the lines in the range you want checked
  are filling up (and filled is configurable by you as well) then Lines will
  determine a user to disconnect to clear room for a user with higher 
  priority. Lines does this by checking for which key a user has, and by how
  long the user has been online. The user with the lowest priority (key) who
  has been on the longest time will be warned, then disconnected.  He will 
  then be delayed from reconnecting for an amount of time you specify. Lines
  can also save complete statistical information on log-ons, warnings, 
  disconnects and delayed log-ons in a text file. All options and text
  blocks are configurable in CNF.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Log-on Lottery -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X $40.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Offers users the chance to buy a ticket when they log on to win the pot 
  of credits in the Lottery. Each night at BBS clean-up time the winning 
  numbers are drawn, and your users could be the lucky winners. A fun way
  to get users to purchase and spend credits. Many options configurable
  including number of digits, starting pot, cost to play, and even your 
  profit along with all text blocks.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Logon Notifier -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X $40.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This module tells you when people logon or off and how many lines are in
  use when users log on. It can be turned on and off globally and has many 
  Sysop configuration options. Now includes user log-on and log-off 
  messages to display to others.  Logon Notifier does not pester users who
  are in the Editor with notices, and Sysops can send messages when 
  toggling invisibility. Also gives Sysops the true number of users on 
  line and only actual (rather than faked) log notices.  
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV NoGhost -                                                        C/S
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X $50.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NoGhost allows your users to handle "ghosting" problems on their own. No 
  more calls from irate users saying their account is on and they can't get
  onto the BBS! If a user logs on, and his account is still online, the 
  online account is disconnected and he is logged on. A message is placed 
  in the Audit Trail informing you of what happened. Optionally Email is 
  sent to the user informing him that his account was logged on as well. 
  You can configure which lines you want to allow users to be able to do 
  this on. This module also prevents users from checking for invisible 
  Sysops by trying to log on as someone else to see if they are online (for
  the lines you allow the module to de-ghost only). Ghost busting can be 
  recorded in the Audit Trail. Worldgroup version allow C/S users to 
  de-ghost their accounts while connecting in C/S mode!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Password Protection -                                            C/S
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $50.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Allows the Sysop to force users to change their passwords at intervals 
  you select. Also lists your last five log-on and log-off dates and times.
  You decide how often passwords have to be changed, as well as if Sysops
  need to change.  Also gives a menu option allowing users to change their
  password at any time. Verifies the change by making them enter it twice, 
  unlike the one included in the User Account Editor, and allows them to
  change their passwords even if they don't have access to the User Account
  Editor.  All options and text blocks are configurable by the Sysop in 
  CNF. Worldgroup version now includes a C/S interface as well as the 
  standard A/A interface.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Picture Gram -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $40.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Allows users to send ANSI pictures with messages to other users in Email.
  You can choose and edit the ANSI pictures in CNF, and decide whether to 
  charge users credits to send the Picture Grams, who can use the module by 
  key, what all the text blocks say, and many other options. 50 different
  ANSI pictures in all to choose from, and you can easily replace the 
  standard pictures with other ANSIs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Rename -                                                         C/S
  MBBS, WG 1.X, 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $50.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Allows Sysops to change a user's handle without creating a new account. 
  Also allows users to change their own handles, with the option of 
  charging them for the priviledge, either credits or days in class. Rename
  ends the hassle of having to create a new account and then switch class, 
  give keys, access and credits and then delete the old account.  Now you
  can do everything in one easy step. All options and text blocks are Sysop
  configurable in CNF. Handle changes are recorded in the Audit Trail.
  Worldgroup version adds options to copy Email and registry entries to the
  new handle, and list changes in a text file, as well as a C/S interface.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Rules -                                                          C/S
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $50.00
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Rules allows you to display your system rules to callers who lack the
  required key (normally new callers but may be existing callers too). They
  must view your rules when they log-on and agree to abide by them, or be
  denied access to your system until they agree. The rules you display can
  be a text file of any length for A/A users, and 32k for C/S users. The
  caller's acceptance of your rules can be shown in the Audit Trail and a 
  text file if you wish. Users who agree to your rules can be given any or
  all of  the following; a key, credits, or a new class. Includes 
  interfaces for both A/A and C/S users in the Worldgroup version. All
  options are configurable in CNF. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Suspend -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X $40.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Allows Sysops to suspend users with a global command for a desired number
  of days, after which your BBS will automatically unsuspend the user for
  you. A great help when you don't want to have to worry about remembering 
  who to unsuspend on what date. Does not require you to use a midnight 
  cleanup routine to unsuspend. All options and text blocks are
  configurable in CNF. Records suspensions in the Audit Trail.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Sysop Lister -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $40.00                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Shows people who your staff members are when they connect to the system.
  When users connect, a message is displayed showing them which staff
  members are online if they need assistance. You configure who is listed 
  as being staff by key. Also gives a global command which will display who
  the online staff members are at any time, and includes the option to tell 
  your staff that a user may need help. Can record the use of the global
  command in the Audit Trail.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Telnet -                                                         C/S
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $50.00
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Allows you to have new users who log-in on a desired range of lines for 
  the first time to be automatically switched to a class you desire. This
  allows you to have new users who telnet to your system to be 
  automatically upgraded in access for the number of days you wish and even

  having to search for and upgrade the access of users who telnet to your
  BBS for good! Switches are recorded in the Audit Trail. The Worldgroup
  version works with both C/S and A/A users. It also allows you to keep
  telnet users from calling in on your dialup lines.

  perform, such as giving or removing keys, suspending or unsuspending 
  users, deleting users, creating a new user account, or sending an email

  including internet, and send an email message to each address, including

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Time List allows you to keep track of your users usage of the BBS, and 
  convert the usage to a format convenient for invoicing. It prints your 
  users dates and and times of system usage to a text file once a month on
  the day you specify during midnight cleanup.  The text file will contain
  each user's times and total minutes and credits used for the call. It is
  outputted in a format which you can put into a database for conveniently
  billing users for their time used. You control which users do and do not 
  have their usage listed by key.  The Worldgroup version works with both 
  C/S and A/A  users. It also gives users the ability to view their system 
  usage for the current and previous month. A/A users have a global command
  while C/S users have a menu option. Keeps track of SLIP/PPP usage times 
  and keeps track of time in seconds rather than minutes for more accuracy.
  Also displays information such as whether users were telnetting and on 
  the Remote Console.  Time List can send an Email message to each user 
  with his connection times attached in a text file each month. 
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Trader -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $40.00
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Allows your users whose classes use days in class to trade days for 
  credits and credits for days in class. This lets them play games which
  require credits, and if they win they can turn their credits back into 
  days in class. Use of the module is keyed and credits and days are 
  traded at rates you set. You can also charge for each trade made if you
  wish. Trades are recorded to the Audit Trail at your option, and all 
  text blocks can be configured to suit your tastes. A must have for 
  systems using classes with days in class and games which require credits.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ ADV Vacation -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $40.00
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This module allows your users to place their accounts on "vacation" for a
  period of time. While they are on vacation, their days in class are
  protected and their account is protected from being deleted. They can
  choose to end their vacation early by logging on (Vacation automatically
  ends a vacation whenever a user connects to your system, even in
  SLIP/PPP). Vacation dates can be changed or stopped at any time, and 
  Sysops can list and edit or delete user's vacations. The module is keyed 
  so you can control who has access, and of course all the displays can be 
  edited.  You can optionally charge users for this service, either credits
  or days in class, and users can be reminded of upcoming vacations at 
  log-on. This module is a big convenience for both the user and the Sysop.
  Sysops can set vacations for other users.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADV Waiting Room -
  MBBS, WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $40.00
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Waiting Room is a place where users can sit while waiting for friends to  
  log on. While in the Waiting Room they are not charged credits, and the   
  time they are on-line does not count against their time limits. They can  
  see who is on-line in the Waiting Room, and optionally may receive log    
  notices, but cannot use global commands or do anything else. This is the  
  perfect way to increase your system usage, as it keeps users on-line      
  while they wait for others rather than calling in and logging off after   
  30 seconds. You can set a delay of how soon users can enter the Waiting   
  Room after leaving it to prevent them from running in and out and abusing 
  it. All options are configurable in CNF including text blocks.

  a picture of that Years Sign, and give you information to describe what 
  kinda people are born during that "Year".  Works for both MBBS and WG.

Cybertank -                                           
  MBBS, WG 1.X, 2.X, 3.0DOS, 3.0NT $295.00
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  By far the most advanced war game out on the BBS market, Cybertank
  offers your users competitive conflict on a global scale. Armed with
  Cybertanks 10 kilometers wide, they conquer a vast continental landscape
  where terrain provides strategic passage for the wise, and surreptitious
  ambush for the crafty. A place where a wise ruler can build a great
  nation, even to become a superpower, able to unleash the power of
  the atom upon those who would oppose him.

  FEATURES:

  * Players can build their own Cybertanks from the Ground up.
    A wide selection of Armor types, Suspension units, Weapons,
    Defense Systems, and Fire Control Computers lets your users
    create their own one-of-a-kind Armored Fighting Vehicle.

  * A global terrain map adds a whole new dimension to combat.
    Here terrain plays an important factor as to what areas players
    can move through as well as the cover it offers from enemy fire.

  * Of the weapons systems Strategic Nuclear weapons are by far the most
    powerful and interesting.  Not only will they deliver tremendous
    damage when used against an opposing AFV, they will permanently alter
    the landscape - reducing hundreds of miles of mountain, water, and
    forest to ashen radioactive desert.  Your players will enjoy being
    able to make permanent changes to the game map (at least until the
    next game!)

  * Not just a combat game. Rising to the ranks of Superpower is largely
    based on ability as a Ruler. Controlling provinces, building
    capitals and factories, allocating labor and resources - virtually
    all the tools of statecraft are at their disposal. A wise ruler over
    a good province would do well, but a tax-happy tyrant over an
    aggressive population may find them revolting against him!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Can you survive the Electronic Lunchroom?
  The Junior High lunchroom is fraught with peril: girls with the cooties,
  wimps who ties your shoelaces together, and, of course, bullys who tease
  you.  It's no wonder the average student needs to defend himself with
  the most deadly weapon available - Food!

  The game is simple, defend yourself from Pranks, Teasing, and Food
  while keeping yourself as clean as possible.  The teachers assume that
  the messier a student is, the more involved in the food fight he is and
  it's off to the principal's office when they catch you.

                     What's on the menu:

  * ANSI food. Users will love to be able to cover their screen in slime!
    Hopefully the spinach won't drip off your monitor into your keyboard.

  * Pranks.  Everything from tying shoes to teasing!

  * Social status. Who's the coolest. Who's the toughest.

  * Advancement. Start in 1st grade and advance toward Food Fight Alumni.

  Best of all, it happens right in teleconference!  One minute, the same
  boring chit-chat, the next, a full fledged brawl.  Of course, users who

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  "Pay attention Galacticomm Sysops.  If you are tired of spending hundreds
  of dollars for Galacticomm add-on software, take a close look at INFIBASE,
  a slick, easy-to-use application development program from InfiNetwork.

  InfiBase is a hierarchical databse that can meet multiple needs for
  Galacticomm Sysops.  In fact, with a little imagination, Sysops can design
  any application requiring collection and dissemination of information that
  can be classified in a hierarchy.  Best of all, the Sysop doesn't have to
  be a programmer to develop custom applications.

  Infibase can be viewed as a single solution for multiple problems.  
  Surprisingly, Infibase solutions in many cases are as elegant and 
  effective as some of the single-purpose third party add-ons.  With a
  little sweat and ingenuity, this program can enhance the functionality of
  your BBS, improve caller satisfaction, and collect your money for you. 
  You can give your online programs a unified look, feel, and command
  structure.  It can save you hundreds if not thousands of dollars in third
  party software.  InfiBase not only will solve many of your immediate
  needs but, as your system grows, it will help you meet many of your
  future needs with minimal expense" 
  SySop News and Cyberworld Report, Dec 1994, Steve Graves

  Sometimes it's nice to gently correct a user who's been slightly
  annoying without alienating and angering them.  The MajorBBS Jail
  provides just that, a light-hearted approach to correctional
  punishment.  This way, the problem is handled and everyone leaves
  in a good mood.  It also adds a bit of mystery to your system as

Online Publisher Suite -                                               
  WG 1.X, WG 2.X, WG 3.0DOS, WG 3.0NT $995.00

              Want to host many publications and magazines 
                on your system like America Online does?

                    Online Publisher is for you.

  If you are looking to host a large number of publications on your
  system from various external content providers, you'll need online
  publisher. From the publishing tools needed by your content providers 
  to the viewing software needed by your readers, this publishing suite 
  provides everything you need to offer fully interactive multimedia 
  publications on your online service.

  What is does
  ------------
  Online Publisher is the next step in electronic publication
  distribution, allowing you to provide readers with fully interactive
  multimedia publications in both the online and *offline* environments
  (Yes, you can also create a CD with your content on it).

  It is a comprehensive product suite for the total lifecycle of a 
  publication, making it easier to take a publication from its initial
  creation to deployment on an online service (currently 
  Galacticomm's Worldgroup).  Unlike HTML publications on the Web,
  content providers don't have to spend a lot of time in a layout stage,
  formatting documents for online presentation. Nor do they have to 
  spend a lot of time with the web programmer each time they add a new 
  issue online.

  The Online Publisher solves the number one problem that plagues online
  electronic publications -- the large size of files containing imbedded
  graphics.   This is particularly important in the online world where
  readership is discouraged by requiring a reader to endure a long
  download of a large file before it can be viewed.  The Online Publisher
  is designed to place an entire publication online, unlike traditional
  "document capture" tools whose size quickly becomes unwieldy when 
  combining multiple documents of a publication.  Using a segmented
  approach and providing in real time only those pieces a reader requests
  reduces reader wait time and increases readership.


  How it works
  ------------
  Readers navigate a publication using a familiar "magazine-like" 
  interface to quickly reach items of interest to them.  Once there, a 
  reader can browse an article or view attached multimedia files 
  including graphics, sound and video.  Attached article items can also
  be program executables that will be launched when a user selects 
  them - allowing them, for example, to "test-drive" software they've
  just read about.  Moreover, all access to articles and attached 
  items (advertisements, charts, etc.) is recorded.  Publishers will
  know more than that a "hit" was made, they'll know "who" made that
  hit.  This provides accurate readership information to advertisers
  and content providers, information that can't be identified with
  print publications and is unavailable with Web-type browsers.

  By providing a seamless interface to other applications on an online
  service, the Online Publisher gives content providers the ability to
  extend publications beyond simple information presentation. 
  Interactivity is increased by allowing readers to e-mail the editor
  or authors directly.  Feedback and discussion can be promoted by
  offering online discussion areas.  Readers can even order items
  advertised in an issue by accessing an online shopping mall.

  Who might use it
  ----------------
  How a community-based system might use it...

  A local online service may wish to offer local organizations 
  (Churches, Special interest clubs, Community groups, etc.) the 
  ability to take their newsletters and association publications and 
  easily put them on the it's online system.  This gives the smaller
  organization a low-cost entry into the online world, and the 
  online system benefits from an increased customer base as the
  organization brings all of it's members online.

  How a national online system might use it...

  A national online service, targeting a specific industry, could
  offer a place on it's system to all the industry-specific trade 
  publications. The Online System then becomes a one-stop-shop for
  all industry related information - increasing it's customer base
  as each publication brings it's members online.  The publication,
  in turn, can increase advertising revenue by offering it's 
  sponsors the option to post an online advertisement in addition
  to their printed material - all without having to invest in
  building their own Internet presence.  And the reader is no 
  longer searching the Internet, hopping from site to site, and
  working his way through different interfaces for each publication.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This module does a couple of things. First it'll add a new global
  for use with your BBS, This allows you to extend a users time either
  for the good or for the bad. Very useful if you have a user that has
  spent there allowed time on-line for the day and decides they want to
  pay and have more time. You can take time away that they have been on
  effectively allowing him back on for that amount of time. Another thing
  that global is good for is that it will allow you to add or take time 
  away from a user that is currently on-line. The other part of this 
  module allows you to add Time restraints to those users with unlimited 
  time per call to stay on if the bbs isn't busy and restrict them to a 
  configurable time limit if the BBS is Busy. It can be set up to count 
  lines 3-13 or any number of lines that you have configured as long as 
  there consecutive and that there is a configured channel for that line #.
  Also has a Built in Prime Time Routine with Max-Time-Per-Day, and Key
  allowed to Logon during Primetime. Now has Different Prime times
  configured depending on what day of the week it is when the BBS is
  brought up.

  Default Will display any and all file transfer being done on the system. 
  Will display User-Id, File Name, BPS, Uploading/Downloading, Percent Done

  your users to have that money available to the system, in order to make 
  those purchases.

  bank account.

   - Send in a cheque or money order for deposit.
   - Bring in cash, in person.
   - Use your credit card.
   - Or even allow them to "borrow" from the system.

  Once your users have those funds in their account, they can make purchases
  as they need to.

 computer players. In this game the users mode around and try to stomp
 each other before they get stomped. So if two users are side by side
 on the grid and the left user hits his right arrow key before the right
 user hits his left arrow key then he wins and continues to stomp other
 users. The stomped user is sent to a waiting room where he can talk to
 other players.
