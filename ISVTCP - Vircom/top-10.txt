                Top 10 Reasons To upgrade to MajorTCP/IP
                ----------------------------------------

Early in 1994, Vircom shook the MajorBBS world by shipping the first 
release of what was to become a success story: MajorTCP/IP.

MajorTCP/IP enabled MajorBBSes from all over to world to connect to 
the Internet, something that had been possible only with complex UNIX 
or Netware based hybrid systems. 

For some time, MajorTCP/IP was the only choice Sysops had if they 
wanted to connect their system to the Internet. While other options 
now exist, we hope that the following chart and associated text will 
convince you that, in 1996, MajorTCP/IP is still the best solution 
when connecting your Worldgroup/MajorBBS server to the Internet or 
TCP/IP Intranets.

Choose the leader, the innovator, Vircom's MajorTCP/IP!

1.  Save on User Six-Packs
--------------------------

One of the most costly areas for Worldgroup/MajorBBS is the User 
Six-Packs.  With MajorTCP/IP, User Six-Packs are not required for most 
of our features, therefore saving you a lot of money.

Some Web browsers can be configured to make multiple requests on the 
server simultaneously; for example, to download images from a Web 
page. Netscape(tm) can be configured to make up to six concurrent 
requests. With ICO/AIO, you would require a whole User Six- Pack for 
a single person browsing on your server.  The money you save with 
MajorTCP/IP on User Six-Packs alone pays for our software.

2.  Multi-Homing: Telnet/Rlogin Server (Virtual BBS)
----------------------------------------------------

Your Worldgroup server can be configured to listen to multiple IP 
addresses, providing a powerful method of hosting multiple virtual BBS 
on the same Worldgroup server.  When a Telnet/Rlogin connection is 
established, MajorTCP/IP defines a pseudo-key based on the IP address 
called.  Used in conjunction with products such as Wilderland Software's 
Virtual User, different login screens and menu trees could be displayed.


3.  Multi-Homing: SMTP Email (Virtual Domains)
----------------------------------------------

The domain added to the User ID on outgoing E-mails can be different 
based on the user's class.  Added to MajorTCP/IP's multiple mail 
aliases, it is possible to truly handle mail for different domains.  
There is no limit of virtual mail domains on the same Worldgroup server.


4.  Multi-Homing: WebServer (WWW Virtual Domain)
------------------------------------------------

Based on the IP address the WWW request came for, web pages stored in 
different directories will be transmitted to the browser.  Since the 
information is kept in distinct menu tree structure for each IP 
address, maintenance of the client's web site becomes an easy task. 
Our Web server can keep independent access log files for each Web site 
and, when combined with our Extended Log Format feature, it becomes a 
simple procedure to compile statistic/billing information for each Web 
site using log analyzers such as WebTrends(tm).

5.  Multi-Homing: FTP Server (Virtual FTP Sites)
------------------------------------------------

A seperate anonymous class can be created for logins in each different
IP address defined on the system.  This allow Sysops to create
"virtual" anonymous FTP site that will give access to different sets
of libraries, depending on the FTP Server address (or hostname)
selected by the user.


6.  Distributed MajorBBS Architecture
-------------------------------------

The Distributed MajorBBS Architecture (DMA) allows you to distribute 
part of your Worldgroup/MajorBBS services and DLLs to other computers 
on your Local Area Network (or to other sites on the Internet) while 
making this transparent to your users. With this setup, you can keep 
the main server busy answering your modems, while the more 
hardware-intensive modules are running on another computer, thus 
improving speed and reliability. 

The DMA Client is included in the Combo version of MajorTCP/IP, 
whereas the DMA Client for ICO/AIO costs 250$.


7.  Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)
------------------------------------------

Our SLIP/CSLIP/PPP dialer (to connect to your provider via modem) and 
our SLIP/CSLIP/PPP server (to allow your customers to connect to you) 
supports PAP in PPP mode. This allows for scriptless connections with 
Windows 95/NT. All you or your Windows 95/NT customers need to do is 
to configure the username, the password and the phone number to dial 
to. That's it! When connecting to your provider in PPP mode, your 
provider must support PAP in order to connect using this method. 
(Note: For Windows 3.x and Trumpet WinsockT users, the only thing you 
need to set up in the script is the dialing procedure to your server.)

 
8.  Automatic DNS negotiation with PPP
--------------------------------------

A Domain Name  Server address will be assigned and automatically 
configured if the customer is using a dialer that supports it, such as
Windows 95/NT
 
When combining the last two features mentioned, customers using 
Windows 95/NT can connect to your server as if connecting to any other 
ISPs. However, this procedure may even be easier than connecting to 
other ISPs, since not every ISP has an environment with so many 
advantages and features.


9.  WebServer: Password (key) protected pages
---------------------------------------------

Access to some pages can be secured either with an IP address or a 
key.  In the latter case, the browser will prompt the user for a BBS 
userid & password. The server will then check to see if that user has 
the proper key to view the page. This can be used to create a secured 
menu tree with web pages, just like the terminal or client-server menu 
trees. 


10.  RLogin+ scripting
----------------------

You can use our RLogin+ proprietary protocol to pass values to an 
external server (UNIX, DMA) if you wish to run one alongside to your 
main server.  This allows you to have the flexibility over UNIX 
servers to run Archie, Gopher and many other applications. Some of 
our clients have used this scripting capability to integrate Wildcat 
5 servers as services within a WorldGroup system. Furthermore, you 
can make RLogin+ connections transparent to your users, so it all seems
like a tight integrated environment.
