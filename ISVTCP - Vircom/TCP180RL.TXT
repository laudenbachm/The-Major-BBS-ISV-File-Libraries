                    MajorTCP/IP version 1.80

     (IDENT, NNTP and POP3 servers & IDENT and IRC clients)


For Immediate Release

Wednesday, December 20, 1995


(Montreal, Quebec, Canada)  Vircom Inc., makers of the
MajorTCP/IP Internet connectivity solution and of the Distributed
MajorBBS Architecture (DMA) lines of products for The MajorBBS
and Worldgroup platforms, is announcing the production release of
MajorTCP/IP version 1.80.  The notable improvements and features
of this new release are:

     IDENT Client and Server:  This security feature, although
     not foul-proof, allows your system to exchange userid
     information with remote Internet hosts.  This validation
     method is often used by IRC servers, which would otherwise
     refuse a connection from a site without an Ident server.
     The Ident client attempts to identify the userid of a TELNET
     caller on the remote system (s)he is calling from.  This
     feature has already helped many SysOps catch hackers and
     abusive competitors.
     
     NNTP Server:  Carry Usenet (Internet) newsgroups directly in
     your system's forums, giving your users the advanced
     functionality of QWK packets for off-line reading and of the
     Client/Server graphical user interface.  Highlights of the
     NNTP server are:
     
          * Key-based security for posting to newsgroups
          * Billing surcharges by messages, attachments and/or
            kilobytes
          * News traffic does not take any user-count licenses
          * For security, NNTP traffic may be restrained to a
            single newsfeed
          * Supports both The MajorBBS 6.25 and Worldgroup platforms
          * System signature tagged at the end of each posting
     
     POP3 Server:  Through a TCP/IP connection to the system,
     either using MajorTCP/IP's passthrough SLIP server, a LAN
     connection or over the Internet, users are able to read
     their Emails using standard POP3 mail agents, such as
     Eudora, and even Windows '95's Mail Exchange.  Highlights of
     the POP3 server are:
     
          * Key-based security for using POP3 server
          * Billing surcharges by time, messages and/or kilobytes
          * POP3 traffic does not take any user-count licenses
          * For security, POP3 traffic may be restrained to local
            connections only
          * Compliant with RFC1725 standards
          * Supports MIME file attachments
          * Supports optional UIDL for POP3 mail agents requiring it
     
     IRC Client:  In addition to already being able to use a
     graphical IRC client through MajorTCP/IP's passthrough SLIP
     server, users will now be able to discuss on the Internet
     Relay Chat with this new IRC client.  Highlights of the IRC
     client are:
     
          * Mimics Tele-conference user interface to ease learning
          * DCC receive file transfers
          * DCC chat (one on one)
          * Key-based security for DCC file transfer access
          * Configurable access to adult material
          * Background performance optimization for a default IRC
            server
          * Supports both The MajorBBS 6.25 and Worldgroup platforms
     
     New software manual:  The software manual for MajorTCP/IP
     was completely rewritten.  The step by step approach of the
     new manual, and its 160 pages, has already helped many
     clients.
