DISTRIBUTED MAJORBBS ARCHITECTURE Product Line
----------------------------------------------

The Distributed MajorBBS Architecture provides the ability to migrate
add-ons off a Worldgroup server, onto a second PC running Vircom’s 
DMA server.  The DMA client, running on the main system, transparently
logs the user in the DMA server and starts the add-on.  The integration
is such that most users won’t realize the add-on is not running on the
same system.

RADIUS Product line
-------------------

The RADIUS server, used in conjunction with the terminal server 
technology, can be used as a growth model to increase the maximum number
of access lines, phone or otherwise, well beyond the current 
possibilities.  The RADIUS server lets your Worldgroup system
authenticate, and bill/track, PPP/SLIP users without logging them into
the Worldgroup system!

Highlights of features:

  Increased PPP speed without impacting Worldgroup performance
  Keep PPP users surfing even during crashes or shutdowns of Worldgroup
  No ceiling in number of phone lines
  Setup remote points of presence
  Galacticomm 6-packs are no longer required for each line
