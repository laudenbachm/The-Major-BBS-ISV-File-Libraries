These are a list of functions available in PSI's utilities.

-----------------------

Features:

All LEVEL3 and LEVEL4 configurations are online for your convenience.
Command concatenation and optional changing of commands to suit
your system has been programmed in.  We decided to code more powerful
commands and let the sysops determine how they are used rather than to
limit them.

Several functions are offered FREE and will work without registration,
but we are sure if you use these functions, you will get to like them
and send in the small reg fee. :)

DETAILED LIST

FREE Functions available:  (will not EXPIRE)

(I put the free ones on the top because everyone likes free stuff)   :)


Search keyring   :       <FREE> <FREE> <FREE> <FREE> <FREE>

    Allows a sysop to search thru personal, class, and master key rings
    of every user/sysop on the system.  Allows you to search for
    exact matches or close matches.


True List Users  :       <FREE> <FREE> <FREE> <FREE> <FREE>

    This command will pull infomation out of the LEVEL6 msg for each
    account, and displays it to the users screen.  On my system, we
    display only the userid and last line of their address, (City, State
    and ZIP), but you can configure the LEVEL6 for any of PSI's text
    variables.  A list of the variables are in the docs.  This also
    allows 'parsing' of that line.

    Example: listusr ted -- will display all lines with the word 'ted'
    in them.  Powerful search utility if you limit it to sysop only and
    put full account information in it.

SYSOP COMMANDS
-----------------------

These commands are primarily used by sysops on my system.


Sysop change userid :

    Just like the change userid function below, but the sysop can enter
    in variable credit charges for name change, confidentiality, and
    suspend or delete the account.

New User creation:

    This allows a sysop to create new users on the fly by typing in
    only the fields (s)he wishes, (besides the required userid and
    class).  It uses a full screen editor and is easy to use.  There
    is also an optional email sent to the user or another address
    from LEVEL6 messages.

Day Add         :

    Allows a sysop to add days to a class or many classes on the fly.
    Optionally emails the user who received days about adding the
    days to their account.

Credit Add      :

    Allows a sysop to add credits to a class or many classes on the
    fly.  Optionally emails the user who received the credits about
    adding them to their account.


Certificate create:

    Allows a sysop to create certificate numbers for redemption by
    users.  Can change a class, add days or credits to a user's
    account by them redeeming a code.


USER COMMANDS (mostly)
-----------------------

UserID changer   :

    This allows a user to change his/her userid by answering simple
    questions.  The userid will follow guidelines set by you in
    your configuration for normal userids, (profanity checking,
    numbers in userids, etc).  Charges are assessed via the online
    configuration by the sysop.  Optional charges can be allowed for
    confidential name changes, which are left out of the user listing.
    Charges even apply if the user is 'credit exempt' unless they
    have the 'exempt' key, (in the online configuration).

    Sysops may also configure if the account is to be suspended or
    deleted by default.


List userid changes:

    Sysop access will display the last # of names which were changed,
    (also determined by sysop configuration), showing who changed their
    name, the name changed to, date, time and if it was confidential.

    For the normal user, the list command will only list non-confidential
    account changes, if they have access.


Account Editor   : (obsolete in WG3.0)

    Normally, there would be no need to have an account editor but if
    your system is like my system, when someone decides to leave your
    system with their 3 bad checks, they don't want you to have their
    phone number or address, so they will put a bunch of garbage in
    their account.  What the account editor does is allow a sysop to
    block fields in their account they cannot access, such as real name,
    address, phone number, sex, birthdate, etc.  Even if you leave access
    to all fields, if you toggle on the logging for the account editor
    their OLD information is logged to disk for you to go back thru
    when you have time, or need it.

    SYSOP FUNCTIONS:

    As a sysop, there are times when you might want to edit someones
    information from remote instead of on console or via client server.
    If you type in 'user userid' where the userid is the user you want
    to edit, their information will appear and you may edit it at will.
    Once in the user editor, if you change the 'userid' field, it will
    load up the next person.  You do not have to type in the full name,
    just enough to differentiate between the next user.


Swap Days/Credits:

    These functions allow a user to swap days for credits or credits for
    days.  The exchange rate is set online via configuration.  Max days
    per month that a person can exchange may also be configured.


Redeem           :

    This function allows a user to redeem a code created by a sysop
    for credits, days, or membership.


INTERNAL FUNCTIONS
-----------------------

Birthday Notification :

    Posts a birthday message to a user on logon and optionally posts
    them credits.  If they have access to getting credits, it displays
    one message, else it displays another (we use it for members and
    non-members).  If it's keyed 'DISABLE', the function is disabled.

Email Notification    :

    This function will notify users on the system of low days or credits.
    The thresholds are set by the sysop in the configuration.  Great
    for getting in payments early.  We set ours to 10 days and 3 days
    out.  Works for C/S and PPP users as well.
