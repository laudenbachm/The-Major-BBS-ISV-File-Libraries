Phoenix is back.  It is currently available via our web site at
http://www.magicbbs.com.  It is also on our ftp site, but be sure
to grab the bug fix pieces.  We will place the files on DEMOSYS
as soon as we can repackage them for delivery.

Please call if you have quesitons.

                           Welcome to Phoenix
                     -----------------------------
                     Your users will love you now!



Phoenix is a powerful User-ID changing system that can work with any
online module, any offline utility, and any data file format.

Phoenix has three methods of changing User-ID information.  These will
be referred to as Code-Level, Offline-UIC and Combined.  The Code-Level
method allows developers to implement a "rename__userid()" function in
their modules.  When Phoenix runs at cleanup it will locate these
functions and invoke them during cleanup.  The Offline-UIC method uses
data definition files to specify where User-ID data is located in
specific files.  Currently this method supports Btrieve files.  This
method will allow anyone to implement Phoenix support, even if the
product is not a module or if the product is no longer supported by the
author.  If the data format is not supported by Offline-UIC and the
program that generates the data file is no longer supported by the
author, you can use the Combined method.  This using a Offline-UIC file
to define a Cleanup-Program which will can be written by any one in any
language.  This Cleanup-Program will be called by Phoenix during
cleanup.

Phoenix can only work on User-ID data that it knows about.  Micro Magic
supplies the files to allow it to work with the base Major BBS or
Worldgroup systems.  Any add-ons you have will need their own UIC files
or built-in support. Without which that User-ID data will be lost during
an ID change.

Review the files DEV_KIT.TXT and UIC_SPEC.TXT for more information on
adding Phoenix support to your system.

Place UIC file in your bbs directory.  Phoenix will process ALL UIC
files it finds there.  Be sure to use the correct version of UIC file
for the software you have online.




Make the following additions to your cleanup batch file:

IF NOT EXIST UID.DAT GOTO NOPHOENIX
CALL BBSBTR
UIC > UIC.LOG
CALL UICLEAN$ >> UIC.LOG
DEL UICLEAN$.BAT
DEL UID.DAT
COPY MM_PX.VIR MM_PX.DAT
CALL BBSRMB
:NOPHOENIX

You can use UIC.LOG to determine how much time is being used.


If you develop a product that stores UID information in a self created
databases or files, then you may create a UIC file to accompany that
product.  Actually, you can create UIC files for all your products and
simply state in the file that no UID information is used.  This will
allow your customers to easily determine if your products are supported
by Phoenix.  We expect this approach will limit phone calls to your
customer support.
