Phoenix

     Your users have been asking for it, now you can give it to them. Allow
     them to change their User IDs without losing valuable on-line
     information. Email, high scores, and captured planets can all remain
     after the User-ID change. A developers kit will allow any ISV to add
     Phoenix support to their programs. Even if you have a program without
     Phoenix support, there are ways to add support outside of the program.
     Features include a change request history, charge per use, and access
     locks.

     The following contain Phoenix support. Ask the respective vendors for
     additional information.
      Micro Magic      everything, of course :)
