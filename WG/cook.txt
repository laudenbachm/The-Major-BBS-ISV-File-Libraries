                  Worldgroup NT/95 v3.1 Demo Software
                  -----------------------------------

The Worldgroup NT/95 v3.1 Demonstration software is available through
Galacticomm's Web Site at http://www.gcomm.com/demo, via FTP or through the
Galacticomm Demo System File Libraries.  Anyone interested in downloading the
demo software must have an account on Galacticomm's Demo System in order to
obtain the software.

The Web site provides two methods for downloading most of the demo files:

     - a self-extracting download or
     - InstallfromtheWeb download

This document will provide the steps necessary to get started using the
demonstration software.  The software provided will allow you to experience
the features of Worldgroup and some of the add-on options that are available
for it.  There are some limitations to this version of the baseline software
which are:

     * only six simultaneous callers at any time
     * only five accounts can exist at any time
     * WorldLink Hub will not permit access to the Worldgroup server
     * the online server system will remain active for two hours at a
       time.  After the two hours the server will need to be manually
       restarted to function again.

The Worldgroup NT/95 Demonstration software has the same hardware
requirements as the full shipping version.


Installation
------------

Depending on which method you used to download the Worldgroup Demonstration
software, you may have one or more installation files located on your hard
drive.  If you select the InstallfromtheWeb method of downloading the
software you will be given the option to install directly from the Web,
install from the Web and save the files locally, or save the files locally.
Pick the option that best suites your needs.

In addition to the basic Worldgroup software, three additional products have
are available for you to test out:  ActiBase Add-on for Worldgroup, Active
HTML Teleconference and WebCast Add-on for Worldgroup.  All three modules
will work with the demo server.

The following are the file names to look for when downloading the
self-extracting executables:

     WG312DEM.EXE - Worldgroup NT/95 v3.1 Baseline
     WGHPD31.EXE  - Worldgroup Hypermedia Page Editor
     ACTIBASE.EXE - ActiBase Add-on for Worldgroup
     WEBCAST.EXE  - WebCast Add-on for Worldgroup
     CAST32.EXE   - WebCast Add-on 32bit Stand-alone Broadcaster
     HTMLTELE.EXE - Active HTML Teleconference Update for Worldgroup

Once you have obtained the files you wish to install, you would execute
each one.  You must run the WG312DEM.EXE (or SETUP.EXE if you used
InstallfromtheWeb) first as it creates the initial directory structure.


Activation Codes
----------------

During the installation of the Worldgroup Baseline, the software will
prompt you for an activation code.  Also during the installation of the
ActiBase and WebCast Add-ons you will be prompted for an activation
code.  Make sure that for each add-on option you have installed that you
have entered the appropriate activation code for that product from the
list below:

     Worldgroup NT/95 v3.1 Baseline          -    DEMO
     ActiBase Add-on Option                  -    912908736
     WebCast Add-on Option                   -    832428408

The following files do not require activation codes:

     WGHPD31.EXE  - Worldgroup Hypermedia Page Editor
     CAST32.EXE   - WebCast Add-on 32bit Stand-alone Broadcaster
     HTMLTELE.EXE - Active HTML Teleconference Update for Worldgroup


Upgrading to the full shipping version
--------------------------------------

If at any point during your evaluation you decide to purchase a
license to a full shipping version of this software you can install it
directly on top of the existing software without losing any of the
configuration options.

Installing a full working version of Worldgroup without installing full
working versions of either ActiBase or WebCast will cause these add-ons to
stop functioning until a proper activation code is entered for them.
