			     About EzSoft - "We make software Ez"


Thank you for your interest in EzSoft. EzSoft is devoted to bringing you the 
quality software you want at a price you can afford. Major BBS and Worldgroup 
modules and custom programming are our specialty. We support versions 1.x, 2.x
and 3.x of Worldgroup and version 6.x of The Major BBS. We have been producing
and selling modules for The Major BBS and Worldgroup for over 2 years now, 
with our first module having been released in September 1994. Worldgroup 
versions for our modules have been made recently, and several modules already 
have a C/S interface, while many others will soon have one. 
We now have over 30 modules, most of which are utilities. We plan to 
continue writing utility modules, and we also plan to start producing games 
in 1997 with maybe some business applications as well.

EzSoft will stand behind its programs. You will receive full support for 
any program you buy, by contacting us in the ways listed in EzSoft
Technical Support and Sales below. We will be happy to help you with any 
questions or problems you have.

Regular upgrades will be brought out and will be the product of what you 
tell us you want to see in the program. Owners of the current version 
will get a discount. Bug fixes will be made available free of charge. If the 
program does not work with your version of the BBS you may return it within 
30 days of purchase for a refund. This applies to orders purchased thru us
only; if you purchased a module thru a reseller you will need to find out
what their return policies are.

We are very interested in knowing what kind of programs you want to see for 
The Major BBS and Worldgroup. If we take your original idea for a program and 
produce it, you will receive the program free. It must be your own original 
idea, and not something we are already making or have planned. 

Customers who purchase many programs at once will receive a discount.
Those purchasing five or more modules at the same time will receive a 10% 
discount, while those who purchase ten or more of our modules at the same 
time will receive a 20% discount. This applies to orders purchased thru
us only. We also offer "Value Pack" specials, which are discounts on
selected groups of modules. Our resellers may have other discounts available. 
Only one discount may be used per purchase.

We reserve the right to change our products and prices at any time without 
notice. 

Finally, we now have introduced an ASUP (Automatic Software Update Program).
This allows you to automatically receive every upgrade we make for a module
for a reasonable price for one year. Upgrades will be either be posted to
you on the Galacticomm Demo System, (954) 583-7808 telnet to gcomm.com, or 
sent via U.S. Mail at your option. The cost for the BBS ASUP is half the 
price of the module, while the cost of the U.S. Mail ASUP is the full price 
of the module. Buyers who have purchased multiple modules and received a 
discount can get the same discount on the cost of the ASUP as well. The ASUP 
program is available to all buyers who have purchased on or after 6/15/95.
