    EzSoft Announcer

  This FREE program allows you to send a message at
  intervals to users without a key. A great way to
  bug your DEMO users to pay for access (and also to
  avoid this irritating messsage). You control how
  often the message is sent and who sees it, along
  with the message itself, and even whether or not
  to send it to users in the Full Screen Editor.

    EzSoft Advertiser

  Advertiser allows you to display ads to your users 
  while they are online. It can select ads which you 
  have created and display them at regular intervals 
  you configure. You control who views the ads and who 
  doesn't see them; there is a key for your staff not 
  to see the ads if you wish, and you can configure the 
  ads so they are broadcast to only a selected audience. 
  This audience can be selected to be only males, only 
  females, only adults, only minors, to see an ad only
  once a day, to display only on a certain channel range, 
  to display only during prime time hours you configure, 
  and to be broadcast only to one random user selected 
  at broadcast time. Advertiser allows you to charge 
  companies to offer their products and services to your 
  users, and you can charge premium prices for ads broadcast 
  during prime time, greatly increasing your profitability. 
  Ads can be added, removed and configured while the system 
  is running for maximum flexibility. All of the options can be 
  configured in CNF to suit your needs. Advertiser can even
  keep a record of how often each ad is displayed so you can
  charge for each display if desired.

    EzSoft AFK                                  

  Allows users to tell others that they are away from their 
  keyboards, and to find out when others are away and return. 
  Global command makes telling others and checking on them a 
  snap. When checking other users, you do not have to type the 
  full handle, but only part of it like the /p page command.
  Can be used with actions in the Entertainment Teleconference, 
  or without actions in the standard Teleconference to let 
  users in your Teleconference channel know your status with 
  the same global command. Can also show the user's location
  as "Away From Keyboard" in user listings when users use a
  global user listing command if you don't use the Teleconference
  actions. A must-have module for all multi-line systems. All 
  options and text blocks are fully Sysop configurable in CNF.

      EzSoft Birthday Announcer                

  This birthday lister displays a birthday ANSI drawing and 
  birthday wishes to everyone at log-on if a user has a
  birthday. The user whose birthday is listed is randomly
  selected at each log-on so that everyone has a chance to
  be recognized on their special day. Birthday also shows 
  upcoming birthdays. It can send Email to users on their 
  birthdays, with gift credits or days in class (Worldgroup
  version) if you wish. Includes an option to not show user's 
  ages. All options and text blocks are CNF configurable.

     EzSoft Busy Notifier                      

  Tells you when you can page someone who is "busy" and 
  can't be paged. You are notified as soon as they are
  no longer busy or they log off the system. You don't
  even have to type the user's full handle; just part of
  the handle like the /p <user-id> paging command. It even
  continues to check to see if you can be notified if you
  are "busy" when your notification arrives.
  All options and text blocks are configurable by the Sysop 
  in CNF.

    EzSoft Call Back                           

  Lets you limit users without the key you choose from re-logging
  on within the amount of time you choose. You can set a delay of
  up to 2 hours. Ideal for keeping users with a limit per call
  from logging off or re-logging and coming back right before their
  time expires, freeing a line for someone else. "Prime time" option
  allows you to set when the module runs for during peak times only.
  All options and text blocks are Sysop configurable in CNF. Delays
  are recorded in the Audit Trail. The Worldgroup version works with
  both C/S and A/A users.

    EzSoft Class Change                        
    
  Gives you a global command to switch new users into a desired
  trial class for the desired number of days and at the same time
  optionally post credits. A great convenience to the Sysop in that
  now you can do everything in one simple global command and you
  can configure the number of days that get posted as well as the
  credits so Class Change handles it all for you. You configure
  who can use Class Change by key, and all options and text blocks
  in CNF. Class changes are recorded in the Audit Trail.

    EzSoft Clock                               

  Clock gives you a simple global command, which can be keyed as
  desired, which allows you to change the BBS clock setting without
  taking the system down to DOS. A great convenience for systems
  whose clocks tend to "drift" or are changed by the operation of
  certain modules, for situations like daylight savings time, etc.
  Now you can leave the system up while you update your time and
  the change takes effect immediately!

    EzSoft Colorize                             
   
  Allows your users to insert color and ASCII extended characters        
  into their messages. Works globally for input such as whispers,
  the line editor (but NOT full screen editor), pages, the registry,
  and so on. Users can color their text and background, create
  special effects such as blinking text and reverse video, and
  put extended characters into their input. Coloring text and
  background, special effects and extended characters are all
  keyed individually so you control who gets access to these
  commands. The commands are used with characters that you can
  change in CNF. On-line help that you can edit included. Colorize 
  even strips out redundant ANSI codes so your users can make the 
  largest possible message. Now includes lower ASCII characters
  such as the heart and "beep" characters, and gives you the 
  ability to turn each lower character ON or OFF.

      EzSoft Credit Alert                      

  Tells users when they log-on if their credits or days
  left in class are running low. Also can alert on-line users who
  are running low on credits if their class uses credits, and can 
  alert those who have a limit per call when they are running 
  out of time left. All options and text blocks are configurable
  by the Sysop in CNF. The Worldgroup version alerts both C/S
  and A/A users, and gives the option to send Email alerts to
  your users too.
  New in version 2.2x: Alerts users whose class allows debt when
  they are approaching their debt limit.

    EzSoft Credits

  Credits allows you to define up to 5 classes which you would like
  to have receive free credits each month. You can specify how many
  free credits each class gets. Then during the midnight cleanup
  routine on the day you specify of each month the classes are
  posted free credits. However, their total free credits will never
  exceed the amount they are to be posted; so for example, if a 
  class is to receive 3600 free credits each month, and they have
  1800 free credits left from the previous month, they will start
  out the month with only 3600 free credits rather than 5400. They
  will still keep any paid credits. Great for giving your users
  the ability to play games and use premium services with a limit,
  and they may even wish to purchase more credits as a result!
  You configure all options such as class names, credit amounts,
  and the day of each month to post and balance credits on.

    EzSoft Demo Clean

  Demo Clean allows you to get rid of unused accounts easily and
  automatically. You configure which accounts are deleted (those
  who lack a key you specify), and how many days of inactivity
  before they are tagged for kill. Then during midnight cleanup,
  these users are tagged for kill. A message can be placed both
  in the Audit Trail and in a text file telling you of the tag,
  allowing you the opportunity to remove the tag if you wish.
  If you don't remove the tag, the account will be deleted at
  the next cleanup. Accounts which are protected are not tagged
  for kill.

    EzSoft FreeLine                            

  Keeps DEMO users from tying up your lines. If all lines are
  in use and DEMO users are logged on, FreeLine hangs up on a
  DEMO user after telling him he should pay up to avoid this
  hassle. Keeps a line free for your paying users. Now upgraded
  so you can choose not to have all lines checked, as well as
  how often the program checks the lines. Sysop configures 
  which users get bumped off and which are safe by key, and 
  what the hang-up message says. FreeLine allows you to 
  configure which lines are checked, and logs off the DEMO
  user who has been on the longest time. Records both warnings
  and log-offs in the Audit Trail. Logs off both C/S and A/A 
  users.

    EzSoft Global Post                         

  If you've ever had your system down for a day and had your 
  users complain about losing a day they paid for Global Post 
  will end that headache. It allows posting of days in class 
  and/or credits to all users in a selected class. Now you can 
  keep your users happy and give them the full number of days 
  they've paid for without a major hassle by using this module. 
  Multiple classes can be posted to simultaneously using the
  simple global commands. Also great for Christmas gifts, special 
  promotions, etc. Also allows you to globally set how many days 
  in class all users in desired classes have and how many credits 
  all users in desired classes have using global commands. This
  allows you to set the credits of all users to 0 if you are going
  to a days only system. All options and text blocks are Sysop 
  configurable in CNF. Postings are recorded in the Audit Trail.

     EzSoft Globals                           

  This is a package of global commands that you won't be able to
  live without after you've seen it. Includes macros, Who's Online, 
  screen type and mode, instant log-off, page console and all Sysops
  who are online, chat channels, telegrams, transfer credits and days 
  in class, log-on notices, a switch to not be bothered in the Editor, 
  and many more, including colorize input. Also included are many Sysop 
  commands such as give/take user key including negative keys, switch 
  class, suspend user with automatic unsuspend, post credits and days 
  in class, extend a user's time on-line, and many neat features like 
  the ability to page a user whose page mode is set to OFF and the 
  ability to turn off a user's "Busy". We have made many enhancements 
  to invisibility and the Sysop commands in this version, and users
  can choose whether to show their ages to others in the Who's Online
  display. All commands are keyed, with command strings you define. 
  Very customizable with many options configurable by the Sysop in CNF.

    EzSoft Invisible                           

  Allows Sysops to turn any user invisible, and back to normal 
  again using a global command. Also turns desired users who 
  don't have a key invisible at log-on. It also automatically 
  updates the visibility of users whose access changes while on-line,
  so if a user's class changes he is made invisible or uninvisible
  automatically! Keeps new users from annoying paying members and 
  vice versa. All options and text blocks are configurable by the 
  Sysop in CNF. Use of the global command is recorded in the Audit
  Trail. The Worldgroup version works with C/S and A/A users.

    EzSoft Lines

  Lines allows you to have your system check for the lines filling
  up during prime time hours you configure. If the lines in the
  range you want checked are filling up (and filled is configurable
  by you as well) then Lines will determine a user to disconnect
  to clear room for a user with higher priority. Lines does this
  by checking for which key a user has, and by how long the user
  has been online. The user with the lowest priority (key) who
  has been on the longest time will be warned, then disconnected.
  He will then be delayed from reconnecting for an amount of time
  you specify. Lines can also save complete statistical information
  on log-ons, warnings, disconnects and delayed log-ons in a text
  file. All options and text blocks are configurable in CNF.

      EzSoft Log-on Lottery

  Offers users the chance to buy a ticket when they log on
  to win the pot of credits in the Lottery. Each night at
  BBS clean-up time the winning numbers are drawn, and your
  users could be the lucky winners. A fun way to get users               
  to purchase and spend credits. Many options configurable
  including number of digits, starting pot, cost to play,
  and even your profit along with all text blocks.

      EzSoft Logon Notifier                    

  This module tells you when people logon or off and
  how many lines are in use when users log on. 
  It can be turned on and off globally and has many 
  Sysop configuration options. Now includes user log-on
  and log-off messages to display to others.
  Logon Notifier does not pester users who are in the Editor 
  with notices, and Sysops can send messages when toggling 
  invisibility. Also gives Sysops the true number 
  of users on line and only actual (rather than faked) log
  notices.

    EzSoft NoGhost                             

  NoGhost allows your users to handle "ghosting" problems on
  their own. No more calls from irate users saying their account
  is on and they can't get onto the BBS! If a user logs on, and his 
  account is still online, the online account is disconnected and he 
  is logged on. A message is placed in the Audit Trail informing you 
  of what happened. Optionally Email is sent to the user informing 
  him that his account was logged on as well. You can configure which 
  lines you want to allow users to be able to do this on. This module 
  also prevents users from checking for invisible Sysops by trying to 
  log on as someone else to see if they are online (for the lines you 
  allow the module to de-ghost only). Ghost busting can be recorded in
  the Audit Trail. Versions 1.2 and up for Worldgroup allow C/S users 
  to de-ghost their accounts while connecting in C/S mode!

     EzSoft Password Protection                

  Allows the Sysop to force users to change their passwords
  at intervals you select. Also lists your last five log-on
  and log-off dates and times. You decide how often passwords
  have to be changed, as well as if Sysops need to change.
  Also gives a menu option allowing users to change their
  password at any time. Verifies the change by making them
  enter it twice, unlike the one included in the User Account
  Editor, and allows them to change their passwords even if
  they don't have access to the User Account Editor.
  All options and text blocks are configurable by the Sysop

    EzSoft Rename                              

  Allows Sysops to change a user's handle without creating a 
  new account. Also allows users to change their own handles, 
  with the option of charging them for the priviledge, either
  credits or days in class. Rename ends the hassle of having 
  to create a new account and then switch class, give keys, 
  access and credits and then delete the old account. 
  Now you can do everything in one easy step. All options and text 
  blocks are Sysop configurable in CNF. Handle changes are recorded
  in the Audit Trail.
  Version 1.4 and up for Worldgroup adds options to copy Email and
  registry  entries to the new handle, and list changes in a text
  file, as well as a C/S interface.

    EzSoft Rules                               

  Rules allows you to display your system rules to callers who
  lack the required key (normally new callers but may be existing
  callers too). They must view your rules when they log-on and 
  agree to abide by them, or be denied access to your system until
  they agree. The rules you display can be a text file of any length
  for A/A users, and 32k for C/S users. The caller's acceptance of 
  your rules can be shown in the Audit Trail and a text file if you
  wish. Users who agree to your rules can be given any or all of 
  the following; a key, credits, or a new class. Includes interfaces 
  for both A/A and C/S users in the Worldgroup version. All options 
  are configurable in CNF.

  Allows Sysops to suspend users with a global command for a desired 
  number of days, after which your BBS will automatically unsuspend 
  the user for you. A great help when you don't want to have to worry 
  about remembering who to unsuspend on what date. Does not require 
  you to use a midnight cleanup routine to unsuspend. All options 
  and text blocks are configurable in CNF. Records suspensions in
  the Audit Trail.

  the system. When users connect, a message is displayed showing
  them which staff members are online if they need assistance.
  You configure who is listed as being staff by key. Also gives
  a global command which will display who the online staff members
  are at any time, and includes the option to tell your staff that
  a user may need help. Can record the use of the global command
  in the Audit Trail.

  Allows you to have new users who log-in on a desired range of
  lines for the first time to be automatically switched to a class
  you desire. This allows you to have new users who telnet to your
  system to be automatically upgraded in access for the number of
  days you wish and even given some free credits if desired. This
  module removes the hassle of having to search for and upgrade the
  access of users who telnet to your BBS for good! Switches are
  recorded in the Audit Trail. The Worldgroup version works with
  both C/S and A/A users.
  It also allows you to keep telnet users from calling in on your
  dialup lines.

    EzSoft Time List

  Time List allows you to keep track of your users usage of the
  BBS, and convert the usage to a format convenient for invoicing. 
  It prints your users dates and and times of system usage to a text 
  file once a month on the day you specify during midnight cleanup.
  The text file will contain each user's times and total minutes and
  credits used for the call. It is outputted in a format which you
  can put into a database for conveniently billing users for their
  time used. You control which users do and do not have their usage
  listed by key.
  The Worldgroup version works with both C/S and A/A  users. It also
  gives users the ability to view their system usage for the current
  and previous month. A/A users have a global command while C/S users
  have a menu option.
  New in version 1.2x: Keeps track of SLIP/PPP usage times and keeps
  track of time in seconds rather than minutes for more accuracy.
  Also displays information such as whether users were telnetting
  and on the Remote Console.
  New in version 1.3x: Time List can send an Email message to each
  user with his connection times attached in a text file each month.

    EzSoft Trader                              

  Allows your users whose classes use days in class to trade days
  for credits and credits for days in class. This lets them play
  games which require credits, and if they win they can turn their
  credits back into days in class. Use of the module is keyed and
  credits and days are traded at rates you set. You can also charge
  for each trade made if you wish. Trades are recorded to the Audit
  Trail at your option, and all text blocks can be configured to
  suit your tastes. A must have for systems using classes with days
  in class and games which require credits.

    EzSoft Vacation                             

  This module allows your users to place their accounts on 
  "vacation" for a period of time. While they are on vacation, 
  their days in class are protected and their account is protected 
  from being deleted. They can choose to end their vacation early 
  by logging on (Vacation automatically ends a vacation whenever
  a user connects to your system, even in SLIP/PPP, and in version
  1.6x, your terminal server.). Vacation dates can be changed or
  stopped at any time, and Sysops can list and edit or delete user's
  vacations. The module is keyed so you can control who has access,
  and of course all the displays can be edited. You can optionally
  charge users for this service, either credits or days in class,
  and users can be reminded of upcoming vacations at log-on. This
  module is a big convenience for both the user and the Sysop.
  NEW in version 1.5x: Sysops can set vacations for other users.

    EzSoft Waiting Room                        

  Waiting Room is a place where users can sit while waiting for
  friends to log on. While in the Waiting Room they are not charged
  credits, and the time they are on-line does not count against their
  time limits. They can see who is on-line in the Waiting Room, and
  optionally may receive log notices, but cannot use global commands
  or do anything else. This is the perfect way to increase your system 
  usage, as it keeps users on-line while they wait for others rather
  than calling in and logging off after 30 seconds. You can set a delay
  of how soon users can enter the Waiting Room after leaving it to
  prevent them from running in and out and abusing it. All options are
  configurable in CNF including text blocks.
