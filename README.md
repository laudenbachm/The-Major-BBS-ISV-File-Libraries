# The-Major-BBS-ISV-File-Libraries
This is a collection of most if not all of the ISV "File Libraries" found on The Major BBS demo system from years ago. These ISV folders contain modules for DOS versions of The Major BBS and Worldgroup as well as modules for the NT versions of Worldgroup.

*** Don't assume anything with these files, but the total package was zipped up and uploaded to Virus Total. https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3aee2773fc010b9cf7f5279a735c4be5138d34bd08312ff14c5915583556d878
