Dear Mega Market 1.08 Beta Test Applicant,

     Thanks for expressing an interest in participating in the beta testing
of the C/S Sysop version of Mega Market. In order to qualify for this beta
test, you must currently own a license to the Mega Market or purchase one
through ABS's sales department at 1-407-888-9091. ABS reserves the right to
choose beta test sites and to limit the number of sites participating in
the beta test.

     By signing this letter of understanding you commit to keeping the
Mega Market software secure from unauthorized use.  Your use of the
beta test software is limited to the standard ABS Software
License Agreement in which the software will be shipped.  In addition
you further agree to the following modifications to the standard
ABS License Agreement:

1. Beta software may not be transferred to other parties.

2. You must destroy the beta test software and any beta documentation
   you receive when the commercial version of Mega Market 1.08 officially
   ships.

3. You are not authorized to reprint or distribute any electronic or
   printed documentation provided to you during the beta test period.

4. I agree to treat the ABS developers with respect.

5. I fully understand that the 1.08 version is a *beta*, and as such,
   may crash my system (both Windows and Server). When this happens,
   I will not call up ranting and raving, but rather, will politely
   post exactly what I was doing when the problem occurred in the
   forum, along with the associated GP.OUT or CATASTRO.TXT files.

6. I agree to post any and all bugs found, immediately in the forum.

7. I understand that voice tech support on the 1.08 version will not
   be available until the FINAL MM 1.08 is released.

8. I understand that ABS, it it's own discretion either with or
   without cause, can exclude me from the MM 1.08 beta team at any
   time, and I will simply have to wait for the final release at
   that point.

9. I promise never to ask "When will it be done?"


     When Mega Market 1.08 becomes commercially available, current customers
will automatically be shipped the final software and documentation.
Throughout the beta period, it may be necessary to make patches or full
beta releases available for download from the ABS Online System.
Downloads will be available from the BETA library or the Worldgroupmm forum.

     For help with installing or operating Mega Market 1.08, please participate
in the WorldgroupMM forum on the ABS Online System.  Initially support
will NOT be available through Technical Support.  A notice will be
posted in the Worlgroupmm forum when support will be available through the
Technical Support department. 

     If this agreement is not acceptable to you, or Worldgroup server
downtime is disastrous for your business, please take our suggestion to
wait until the official product release.  If you do decide to work with
the beta version however, then please fill out this form COMPLETELY,
sign it and fax the ENTIRE form back to ABS at 1-407-888-9092

Applicants not completely filling out this form will be rejected.
