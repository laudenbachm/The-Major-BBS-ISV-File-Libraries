InterChat (ChatWorld) Information

GameNet and ChatWorld are pleased to announce the opening of 
"InterChat", a chat network designed solely for WG/MBBS systems. 
InterChat runs on a private IRC server, and is designed to provide 
better control over access, better monitoring, and restrictions on the 
creation of "explicit adult" public channels. Private adult 
conversations and channels will be unaffected by this restriction, 
however public channels will be "PG-13". It is our hope that this will 
be an affordable and value-adding chat service to many general access 
WG/MBBS systems.

InterChat will be accessible several ways: from JavaNet using IBM's 
proprietary Java IRC client which not only allows full use of all IRC 
commands, but also contains URL pushing/accepting and an 
(optionally displayed) real time stock market ticker, from ChatWorld 
via either DMA connection or through a JavaNet Telnet Chat client, 
through any IRC compatible chat client like mIRC, from the Vircom 
or Gcomm terminal mode IRC clients via normal menuing on your 
own system, or from Gcomm's IRC C/S module.

Currently, InterChat can be tested from the ChatWorld main menu 
(for GameNet I) members, from the JavaNet Telnet Chat client, and 
from the JavaNet IBM chat client, which we will allow unrestricted 
access to for the next few days. Beginning at the end of this week, 
InterChat will be available to member systems using their normal IRC 
clients. Access InterChat will be bundled as a no-additional-cost addon 
to GameNet 1 members of record as of 2/28/97. Thereafter, InterChat 
will have an additional cost of $5 monthly for GameNet I member 
systems, and $10 monthly for nonmember systems (nonmember 
system minimum subscription term is quarterly).
