3.0 CONTACTING FARWEST BBS
--------------------------

3.1 Calling via Modem/Telnet
----------------------------

We operate a MajorBBS/WorldGroup system that can be reached in the
following ways:

Modem:  250-381-3934 (14.4 kbps)
Modem:  250-381-1135 (28.8 kbps, 33.6kbps with a USR Courier)

Telnet: farwest.bc.ca

When you first call Farwest BBS, we ask that you sign on as a NEW
user, and answer the standard questions. Please note that Farwest
is a real name system and does not use alias User-IDs, so from
the moment you sign up, your user-id will become your REAL name.
(example: Bob Smith, Sam Kincaid, etc...)

As soon as you answer the last question in setting up your account,
you will be immediately given DEMO access to the system. Please
write E-mail to the Sysop to get your access upgraded. All Major BBS
Sysops are automatically provided with FREE access. This will allow
you to have full access to our system and the ability to download
demos of our modules.

3.2 Calling Voice
-----------------

You can call us voice at the following numbers...

Voice: 250-953-0659 - Aaron Sundberg
or     250-381-6462 - Ren L'Ecuyer

If no one answers when you call, please leave a message on the
answering machine. We return all calls.

-------

Our fax number is 250-381-6462.

3.4 Electronic Mail

Farwest is hooked up to the MajorNet and the Internet. If you are
interested in any of our products, then you can send us private
email to any of these addresses.

MajorNet:                   Internet:
  Info@FAR                    info@farwest.bc.ca

3.5 Regular Mail
----------------

IMPORTANT! This address is for REGULAR mail only! Please DO NOT
send anything to this address using Express Mail, UPS, Purolator,
Federal Express, or any other courier service. They WILL NOT
deliver to this address. Doing so will only result in costly
delays.

Our regular mailing address is

    Farwest BBS
    PO Box 8389
    Victoria BC  V8W 3R9
    Canada

Be forewarned, sending us mail can be VERY slow. From between 7
and 15 days for regular air mail.

3.6 Courier Service
-------------------

If you want to send us something in a hurry, then Federal Express
is the ONLY option. Federal Express guarantees 24 hour delivery
from almost any point in the USA. Two days from Mexico. Please DO
NOT try to use other courier services. They cannot guarantee 24 hour
service to Victoria, BC, They also do not have the same quality of
tracking service.

If you elect to use Federal Express, then you will need a "real
people address" and not a PO box number. Since couriers will not
deliver to a post office box, you can use the following address
for all Fed Ex shipments.

Aaron Sundberg
104-1655 Begbie Street
Victoria, BC  V8R 1L4
Canada

Telephone: 250-953-0659

3.7 Accessing our FTP site
--------------------------

All of Farwest BBS' demos and the most recent version of this file can
be accessed via anonymous ftp at

ftp://ftp.farwest.bc.ca/worldgroup/demos/

We also keep updated versions of our demos and this file on the
Galacticomm demo system accessible at

ftp://gcomm.com/isvfar/


4.0 PURCHASING INFORMATION
--------------------------

4.1 Company Checks, Money Orders, Bank Drafts, Cashier's Check
--------------------------------------------------------------

If you wish to purchase any of our modules, then simply send us a
company check, INTERNATIONAL money order, a bank draft, or cashier's
check made payable to FARWEST BBS, to either of the addresses
mentioned above. Unfortunately we cannot accept any personal checks.

NOTE: We are located in Canada. If you are outside of Canada, please
      ensure that any payment you send is negotiable outside of your
      home country.

4.2 Western Union Wire Transfer
-------------------------------

For those of you that would like to use a credit card for payment,
Western Union is a suitable alternative. Simply check your telephone
book for the Western Union number closest to your location.  Give
them a call, tell them you want to wire money and use your credit
card as a method of payment.

They will ask you for a name (Ren L'Ecuyer or Aaron Sundberg) and
a location (Victoria, BC, Canada) as well as your credit card data.
If you elect to use this approach, then obviously we need to know
a few things such as your name, telephone number and your location
(city and state).

It usually takes about 2 to 3 hours to process.  We contact the local
Western Union representative in Victoria, pick up the money, alter
your user account on our system - and you are free to download.

Western Union does allow an alternative method of payment - and
it sure gets here fast.  As you can expect, there is a fee - but this
is not much more than sending payment via Federal Express.

You may wish to give this method of payment some consideration. If
you do decide to send your payment via Western Union please call
Farwest to confirm the order and the information being given to
Western Union to prevent any confusion.

4.3 After Payment is Received
-----------------------------

As soon as we receive your payment we will give you access to
download the purchased items from our BBS. It is important that
you call our BBS and set up an account as soon as you can.

In the event that you cannot download the purchased items, then
we can do one of two things.

 1) Mail the diskettes to you via a courier. (At your expense).

 2) Mail the diskettes to you via the normal postal service.
    (air mail).

PLEASE - Try to remember the following... There is no explanation,
         but regular mail to and from the west coast of Canada
         can take 7 to 15 days depending on many variables such as
         time of year, distance involved, phase of the moon, etc.

7.4 Othello
-----------

The Othello module is a multiplayer implementation of the board
game  (also known as Reversi or Flipper).  Othello was Farwest's
very first module, written in 1989. Since that time  Othello has
been praised for its clean interface and stability.

Great features include:

a) Full mouse driven interface using RIP.

   list.

   action words, and enter/exit messages.

unlimited action words with the Action Word Add On. (See below).

7.5 Roll the Bones
------------------

Roll the Bones is a multi-player game of chance that can be played
globally from most places on your BBS. Like poker, users put credits
into a pot. They then roll a pair of dice (the bones) several times,
flipping numbered pegs that add up to the dice rolls. They roll the
dice until they can no longer flip any pegs. The remaining pegs (if
any) are tallied, and that becomes the player's score. After everyone
has had their turn, the user with the lowest score wins the pot.

Roll the Bones is very easy to learn. After a single game a first
time player becomes as proficient as a veteran. Additionally, the
game is fast moving. A single game of Roll the Bones takes about as
long to play as a single game of Poker. This short learning curve
and length of game make it ideal for people popping in and out of
Teleconference, or a game like Farwest Trivia.

Roll the Bones is a great addition for any entertainment style BBS.
If you are interested in Roll the Bones it will only cost you $59US.
Give us a call and download the demo.

Develop and sell your own question banks for Farwest Trivia and
Farwest Tele-Trivia. Just create a question bank in text format
using your favorite editor, run a conversion utility, enter the
product information into the Developer's Kit, and you are ready

   question banks.

b) Online product registration and activation code generator for
   your customer's convenience.

c) Online customer editor. Allows for easy license transfers.

The Question Developer's Kit is just $50. You could make this
investment back with just a couple sales of your own question

   Sci-Fi, TV, Geography & History, Literature, Bible, and Kids.
